<h2><a name="i" id="i"></a>1</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">I</span> WAS sitting right that minute in a big white rowboat that
was docked at the end of the pier which ran far out into the
water of the lake. From where I was sitting, in the stern of
the boat, I could see the two brown tents where the rest of the
Sugar Creek Gang was supposed to be taking a short afternoon
nap&mdash;which was one of the rules about camp life none of
us liked very well, but which was good for us on account of
we always had more pep for the rest of the day and didn’t get
too tired before night.</p>

<p>I’d already had my afternoon nap, and had sneaked out of
the tent and come to the dock where I was right that minute,
to just sit there and imagine things such as whether there
would be anything very exciting to see if some of the gang
could explore that great big tree-covered island away out across
the water, about a mile away.</p>

<p>Whew! it certainly was hot out here close to the water
with the sunlight pouring itself on me from above and also
shining up at me from below, on account of the lake was like
a great big blue mirror that caught sunlight and reflected it
right up under my straw hat, making my hot freckled face
even hotter than it was. Because it was the style for the people
to get tanned almost all over, I didn’t mind the heat as much as
I might have.</p>

<p>It seemed to be getting hotter every minute though&mdash;the
kind of day we sometimes had back home at Sugar Creek just
before some big thunderheads came sneaking up and surprised
us with a fierce storm. It was also a perfect day for a sunbath.
What on earth made people want to get brown all over for
anyway? I thought. Then I looked down at my freckled brownish
arm, and was disgusted at myself, on account of instead of getting
a nice tan like Circus, the acrobatic member of our gang, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
always got sunburned and freckled and my upper arm looked
like a piece of raw steak instead of a nice piece of brown fried
chicken.... Thinking that, reminded me that I was hungry
and I wished it was suppertime.</p>

<p>It certainly was a quiet camp, I thought, as I looked at the
two tents, where the rest of the gang was supposed to be sleeping.
I just couldn’t imagine anybody sleeping that long&mdash;anyway,
not any boy&mdash;unless he was at home and it was
morning and time to get up and do the chores.</p>

<p>Just that second I heard a sound of footsteps from up the
shore, and looking up I saw a smallish boy with brownish curly
hair coming toward me along the path that runs all along the
shore line. I knew right away it was Little Jim, my almost best
friend, and the grandest little guy that ever lived. I knew it was
Little Jim not only ’cause he carried his ash stick with him,
which was about as long as a man’s cane, but because of the
shuffling way he walked. I noticed he was stopping every now
and then to stoop over and look at some kind of wild flower,
then he’d write something down in a book he was carrying
which I knew was a wild flower Guide Book.</p>

<p>He certainly was an interesting little guy, I thought. I
guess he hadn’t seen me, ’cause I could hear him talking to
himself which is what he had a habit of doing when he was
alone and there was something kinda nice about it that made
me like him even better than ever. I think that little guy does
more honest-to-goodness thinking than any of the rest of the
gang, certainly more than Dragonfly, the pop-eyed member of
our gang, who is spindle-legged and slim and whose nose turns
south at the end; or Poetry, the barrel-shaped member who reads
all the books he can get his hands on and who knows one hundred
poems by heart and is always quoting poems; and also more
than Big Jim, the leader of our gang who is the oldest and who
has maybe seventeen smallish strands of fuzz on his upper lip
which one day will be a mustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
I ducked my head down below the dock so Little Jim couldn’t
see me, and listened, still wondering “What on earth!”</p>

<p>Little Jim stopped right beside the path that leads from
the dock to the Indian kitchen which was close by the two
brown tents, stooped down and said, “Hm! Wild Strawberry....”
He leafed through the book he was carrying and with his
eversharp pencil wrote something down. Then he looked around
him and, seeing a Balm of Gilead tree right close to the dock
with a five-leafed ivy on it, went straight to the tree and with
his magnifying glass, began to study the ivy.</p>

<p>I didn’t know I was going to call out to him and interrupt
his thoughts, which my mother had taught me not to do, when
a person is thinking hard, on account of anybody doesn’t like
to have somebody interrupt his thoughts.</p>

<p>“Hi, Little Jim!” I said from the stern of the boat where
I was.</p>

<p>Say, that little guy acted as cool as a cucumber. He just
looked slowly around in different directions, including up and
down, then his bluish eyes looked absent-mindedly into mine,
and for some reason I had the kindest, warmest feeling toward
him. His face wasn’t tanned like the rest of the gang’s either,
but was what people called “fair”; his smallish nose was straight,
his little chin was pear-shaped, and his darkish eyebrows were
straight across, his smallish ears were like they sometimes were&mdash;lopped
over a little on account of that is the way he nearly always
wears his straw hat.</p>

<p>When he saw me sitting there in the boat, he grinned and
said, “I’ll bet I’ll get a hundred in nature study in school next
fall. I’ve found forty-one different kinds of wild flowers.”</p>

<p>I wasn’t interested in the study of plants at all, right that
minute, but in some kind of an adventure instead, so I said to
Little Jim, “I wonder if there are any different kinds of flowers
over there on that island, where Robinson Crusoe had his adventures.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
Little Jim looked at me without seeing me, I thought, then
he grinned and said, “Robinson Crusoe never saw <em>that</em> island.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes, he did! He’s looking at it right this very minute
and wishing he could explore it and find a treasure or something,”
meaning I was wishing I was Robinson Crusoe myself.</p>

<p>Just that second a strange voice piped up from behind
some sumac on the other side of the Balm of Gilead tree and
said, “You can’t be a Robinson Crusoe and land on a tropical
island without having a shipwreck first, and who wants to have
a wreck?”</p>

<p>I knew right away it was Poetry, even before I saw his
barrel-shaped body shuffle out from behind the sumac and I
saw his fat face, and his pompadour hair and his heavy eye
brows that grew straight across the top of his nose, like he
had just one big longish eyebrow instead of two like most people
have.</p>

<p>“You <em>are</em> a wreck,” I called to him, and didn’t mean it, but
we always liked to have word fights, which we didn’t mean and
always liked each other better all the time.</p>

<p>“I’ll leave you guys to fight it out,” Little Jim said to us.
“I’ve got to find nine more kinds of wild flowers,” and with
that, that little chipmunk of a guy shuffled on up the shore
swinging his stick around and stooping over to study some new
kind of flower he spied every now and then.</p>

<p>And that’s how Poetry and I got our heads together to
plan a game of Robinson Crusoe, not knowing we were going
to run into one of the strangest adventures we’d had in our
whole lives.</p>

<p>“See here,” Poetry said, grunting himself down and sliding
down off the side of the dock and into the boat where I was,
“if we play Robinson Crusoe, we’ll have to have one other person
to go along with us.”</p>

<p>“But there were only <em>two</em> of them,” I said, “&mdash;Robinson
Crusoe himself and his man Friday, the colored boy who became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
his slave, and whom Crusoe saved from being eaten by
the cannibals, and who, after he was saved, did nearly all Crusoe’s
work for him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Poetry said, “I’ll be Crusoe, and <em>you</em> be his Man
Friday.”</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> not,” I said. “I’m already Crusoe. I thought of it
first, and I’m already <em>him</em>.”</p>

<p>Poetry and I frowned at each other, almost half mad for
a minute until his fat face brightened up and he said, “All right,
you be Crusoe, and I’ll be one of the cannibals getting ready to
eat your man Friday, and you come along and rescue him.”</p>

<p>“But if you’re going to be a cannibal, I’ll have to <em>shoot</em> you,
and then you’ll be <em>dead</em>,” I said.</p>

<p>That spoiled that plan for a jiffy, until Poetry’s bright mind
thought of something else, which was, “didn’t Robinson Crusoe
have a pet goat on the island with him?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” I said, and Poetry said, “All right, after you shoot
me, I’ll be the goat.”</p>

<p>Well that settled that, but which one of the gang should
be the colored slave, whom Robinson Crusoe saved on a Friday
and whom he named his Man Friday, we couldn’t decide right
that minute.</p>

<p>It was Poetry who thought of a way to help us decide which
other one of the gang to take along with us.</p>

<p>“Big Jim is <em>out</em>,” I said, “’cause he’s too big and would want
to be the leader himself, and Robinson Crusoe has to be <em>that</em>.”</p>

<p>“And <em>Circus</em> is out, too,” Poetry said, on account of he’s
almost as big as Big Jim.</p>

<p>“Then there’s only Little Jim, Dragonfly and Little Tom
Till left,” I said, and Poetry said, “Maybe not a one of them’ll be
willing to be your Man Friday.”</p>

<p>We didn’t have time to talk about it any further, ’cause
right that second Dragonfly came moseying out toward us from
his tent, his spindling legs swinging awkwardly and his crooked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
nose and dragonfly-like eyes making him look just like a ridiculous
Friday afternoon, I thought.</p>

<p>“He’s the man I want,” I said. “We three have had lots
of exciting adventures together, and he’ll be perfect.”</p>

<p>“But he can’t keep quiet when there’s a mystery. He always
sneezes just when we don’t want him to.”</p>

<p>Right that second, Dragonfly reached the pier and let the
bottoms of his bare feet go ker-plop, ker-plop, ker-plop on the
smooth boards, getting closer with every “ker-plop.”</p>

<p>When he spied Poetry and me in the boat at the end, he
stopped like he had been shot at, and looked down at us and
said with an accusing voice, “You guys going on a boat ride? I’m
going along!”</p>

<p>I started to say, “Sure, we want you,” thinking how when
we got over to the island, we could make a slave out of him
as easy as pie.</p>

<p>But Poetry beat me to it by saying, “There’s only one more
of the gang going with us, and it might not be you.”</p>

<p>Dragonfly plopped himself down on the edge of the dock,
swung one foot out to the <a name="gunwale" id="gunwale"></a><ins title="Original has 'gunwhale'">gunwale</ins> of the boat, caught it with
his toes, pulled it toward him, swished himself in and sat down
in the seat behind Poetry. “If anybody goes, I go, or I’ll scream
and tell the rest of the gang, and nobody’ll get to go.”</p>

<p>I looked at Poetry and he looked at me and our eyes said
to each other, “Now what?”</p>

<p>“Are you willing to be eaten by a cannibal?” I asked, and
he got a puzzled look in his eyes. “There’re cannibals over there
on that island&mdash;one, anyway&mdash;a great big fat barrel-shaped
one that&mdash;”</p>

<p>Poetry’s fist shot forward and socked me in my ribs, which
didn’t have any fat on them, and I grunted and stopped talking
at the same time. “We’re going to play Robinson Crusoe,” Poetry
said, “and whoever goes’ll have to be willing to do everything
I say&mdash;I mean everything <em>Bill</em> says.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
“<em>Please</em>,” Dragonfly said. “I’ll do <em>anything</em>.”</p>

<p>Well that was a promise, but Poetry wasn’t satisfied. He
pretended he wanted Tom Till to go along, on account of he
liked Tom a lot and thought he’d make a better Man Friday than
Dragonfly.</p>

<p>“We’ll try you out,” Poetry said, and caught hold of the
dock with his hands and climbed out of the boat, all of us following
him.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to initiate you,” Poetry explained, as we all
swished along together. “We can’t take anybody on a treasure
hunt who can’t keep quiet when he’s told to, and who can’t
take orders without saying ‘WHY?’”</p>

<p>“Why?” Dragonfly wanted to know, and grinned, but Poetry
said with a very serious face, “It isn’t funny,” and we went on.</p>

<p>“What’re you going to do?” Dragonfly wanted to know,
as we started to march him along with us up the shore to the
place where we were going to initiate him. I didn’t know myself
where we were going to do it, but Poetry seemed to know
exactly what to do and where to go and why, so I acted like
I knew too, Poetry making me stop to pick up a great big
empty gallon can that had had prunes in it, the gang having to
eat prunes for breakfast nearly every morning on our camping
trip.</p>

<p>“What’s <em>that</em> for?” Dragonfly wanted to know, and Poetry
said, “That’s to cook our dinner in.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;you mean&mdash;<em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>“You!” Poetry said, “Or you can’t be Bill’s Man Friday.”</p>

<p>“But I get saved, don’t I?” Dragonfly said with a worried
voice.</p>

<p>“Sure, just as soon as I get shot,” Poetry explained.</p>

<p>“And then you turn into a goat,” I said to Poetry, as he
panted along beside us, “and right away you eat the prune
can!”</p>

<p>With that, Poetry smacked his lips like he had just finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
eating a delicious tin can. Then he leaned over and groaned like
it had given him a stomach-ache.</p>

<p>Right that second, I decided to try Dragonfly’s obedience,
so I said, “All right, Friday, take the can you’re going to be
cooked in and fill it half full of lake water!”</p>

<p>There was a quick scowl on Dragonfly’s face, which said,
“I don’t want to do it.” He shrugged his scrawny shoulders
lifted his eyebrows and the palms of his hands at the same
time, and said, “I’m a poor heathen; I can’t even understand
English; I don’t want to fill any old prune can with water.”</p>

<p>With that, I scowled, and said to Poetry in a fierce voice,
“That settles <em>that</em>! He can’t take orders. Let’s send him home!”</p>

<p>Boy, did Dragonfly ever come to life in a hurry. “All right,
all right,” he whined, “give me the can!” He grabbed it out
of my hand, made a dive toward the lake which was still close
by us, dipped the can in and came back with it filled clear to
the top with nice clean water.</p>

<p>“Here, Crusoe,” he puffed. “Your Man Friday is your humble
slave.” He extended the can toward me.</p>

<p>“Carry it yourself!” I said.</p>

<p>And then, all of a sudden, Dragonfly set it down on the
ground where some of it splashed over the top onto Poetry’s
shoes, and Dragonfly got a stubborn look on his face and said,
“I think the cannibal ought to carry it. I’m not even <em>Friday</em> yet&mdash;not
till the cannibal gets killed.”</p>

<p>Well, he was right, so Poetry looked at me, and I at him,
and he picked up the can, and we went on till we came to the
boathouse, which if you’ve read “The Sugar Creek Gang Goes
North,” you already know about.</p>

<p>It was going to be fun initiating Dragonfly&mdash;just how much
fun I didn’t know&mdash;and I certainly didn’t know what a mystery
we were going to run into in less than fifteen minutes of the
next half hour.</p>

<p>In only a little while we came to Santa’s boathouse, Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
as you maybe know being the barrel-shaped owner of the property
where we had pitched our tents. He also owned a lot of other
lakeshore property up here in this part of the Paul Bunyan country.
Everybody called him Santa ’cause he was round like all the different
Santa Clauses we’d seen and was always laughing.</p>

<p>Santa himself with his big laughing voice called to us when
he saw us coming and said, “Well, well, if it isn’t Bill Collins,
Dragonfly and Poetry,” Santa being a smart man, knowing that
if there’s anything a boy likes to hear better than anything else,
it’s somebody calling him by his name.</p>

<p>“Hi,” we all answered him, Poetry setting the prune can
of water down with a savage sigh like it was too heavy to stand
and hold.</p>

<p>Santa was standing beside his boathouse door, with a hammer
in one hand and a handsaw in the other.</p>

<p>“Where to, with that can of water?” he asked us, and Dragonfly
said, “We’re going to pour the water in a big hole up there on
the hill and make a new lake.”</p>

<p>Santa grinned at all of us with a mischievous twinkle in
his bluish eyes, knowing Dragonfly hadn’t told any lie but was
only doing what most boys do most all the time anyway&mdash;playing
“Make-believe.”</p>

<p>“May we look inside your boathouse a minute?” Poetry asked,
and Santa said, “Certainly, go right in,” which we did, and looked
around a little.</p>

<p>Poetry acted very mysterious, like he was thinking about something
very important, while he frowned with his fat forehead, and
looked at different things such as the cot in the farther end, the
shavings and sawdust on the floor, and the carpenter’s tools above
the work bench&mdash;which were chisels, screwdrivers, saws, planes
and also hammers and nails; also Poetry examined the different
kinds of boards made out of beautifully grained wood.</p>

<p>“You boys like to hold this saw and hammer a minute?”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Santa asked us, and handed a hammer to me and a saw handle
to Dragonfly, which we took, not knowing why.</p>

<p>“That’s the hammer and that’s the saw the kidnapper used
the night he was building the gravehouse in the Indian cemetery,”
Santa said, and I looked and felt puzzled, till he explained, saying,
“The police found them the night you boys caught him.”</p>

<p>“But&mdash;how did they <em>get</em> there?” I asked, but Poetry answered
me by saying, “Don’t you remember, Bill Collins, that we
found this boathouse door wide open that night, with the latch
hanging? The <a name="kidnapper" id="kidnapper"></a><ins title="Original has 'kidnapped'">kidnapper</ins> stole ’em.”</p>

<p>I looked at the hammer in my hand, and remembered, and
tried to realize that the hammer handle I had in my hand right
that minute was the same one that, one night last week, had been
in the wicked hand of a very fierce man who had used it in an
Indian cemetery to help him build a gravehouse. Also, the saw
in Poetry’s hand was the one the man had used to saw pieces of
lumber into the right lengths.</p>

<p>“And <em>here</em>,” Santa said, lifting a piece of canvas from something
in the corner, “is the little, nearly-finished gravehouse. The
lumber was stolen from here also. The police brought it out this
morning. They’ve taken fingerprints from the saw and hammer.”</p>

<p>“Why on earth did he want to build an Indian gravehouse?”
I asked, looking at the pretty little house that looked like a longish
chicken coop, like we have at home at Sugar Creek, only twice
as long, almost. Dragonfly spoke up then and said, “He maybe was
going to bury the little Ostberg girl there.”</p>

<p>But Poetry shook his head, “<em>I</em> think he was going to bury
the ransom money there, where nobody in the world would guess
to look.”</p>

<p>Well, we had to get going with our game of Robinson Crusoe,
which we did, all of us feeling fine to think that last week we had
had a chance to catch the kidnapper, even though the ransom
money was still missing.</p>

<h2><a name="ii" id="ii"></a>2</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">B</span><small>UT</small> say, it was a queer feeling I had in my mind as we
left the boathouse and went up the narrow, hardly-ever-used road
to the top of the hill and followed that road through a forest of
jack pine and along the edge of the little clearing. I was remembering
what exciting things happened here the very first night we’d
come up North on our camping trip. Poetry was remembering it
too, ’cause he said in a ghost-like voice so as to try to make the
atmosphere of Dragonfly’s initiation seem even more mysterious
to him, “Right here, at this sandy place in the road, is where the
car was stuck in the sand, and right over here behind these bushes
is where Bill and I were crouching half scared to death, watching
him.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” I said, “and he had the little Ostberg girl he’d kidnapped
right in the back seat of the car all the time and we didn’t
know it for sure.”</p>

<p>“How’d he get his car <em>un</em>stuck?” Dragonfly wanted to know,
even though the whole Sugar Creek Gang had probably been
told it a dozen times, every time Poetry and I had told it to them.
So I said to Dragonfly, “Well, his wheels were spinning and spinning
in the sand and he couldn’t make his car go forward, but it
would rock forth and back, so he got out and let the air out of his
back tires till they were almost half flat. That made them wider
and increased traction, and then when he climbed back into his
car and stepped on the gas, why he pulled out of the sand and
went lickety-sizzle right on up this road.”</p>

<p>“You going to initiate me <em>here</em>?” Dragonfly wanted to know,
and I started to say, “Yes,” but Poetry said, “No, a little farther
up, where we found the little girl herself.”</p>

<p>We walked along, in the terribly sultry afternoon weather.
Pretty soon we turned off to the side of the road and came out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
into a little clearing that was surrounded by tall pine trees. I
was remembering how right here Poetry and I had heard the
little girl gasping out half-smothered cries and with our flashlights
shining right on her, we’d found her lying wrapped up in an
Indian blanket.</p>

<p>“She was lying right here,” Poetry said, “&mdash;right here where
we’re going to initiate you.” Poetry’s ordinarily duck-like voice
changed to a sound like a growling bear’s voice as he talked and
sounded very fierce. There really wasn’t anything to worry about,
though, ’cause we knew the police had caught the kidnapper and
he was in jail somewhere, and the pretty little golden-haired
Ostberg girl was safe and sound with her parents again back in
St. Paul.</p>

<p>“But they never did find the ransom money,” Poetry said,
which was the truth, “and nobody knows where it is. But whoever
finds it gets a thousand dollar reward&mdash;a whole thousand dollars!”</p>

<p>“You think maybe it’s buried somewhere?” Dragonfly asked
with a serious face.</p>

<p>“Sure,” Poetry said. “We’re going to play Robinson Crusoe
and Treasure Island both at once. First we save our Man Friday
from the cannibals, and then we quit playing Robinson Crusoe
and change to Treasure Island.”</p>

<p>Well, it was good imagination and lots of fun, and I was already
imagining myself to be Robinson Crusoe on an island, living all
by myself. In fact, I sometimes have more fun when I imagine
myself to be somebody else than when I am just plain red-haired
fiery-tempered, freckled-faced Bill Collins, living back at Sugar
Creek.</p>

<p>It was fun the way Poetry and I initiated Dragonfly into our
secret gang&mdash;anyway, fun for Poetry and me. This is the way
we did it....</p>

<p>I hid myself out of sight behind some low fir trees with
a stick in my hand for a gun, and Poetry stood Dragonfly up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
against a tree and tied him with a piece of string he carried in his
pocket.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t you <em>dare</em> break that string!” Poetry told him.
“You’re going to be cooked and eaten in a few minutes! You
can pretend to <em>try</em> to get loose, but don’t you dare do it!”</p>

<p>I stood there hiding behind my fir trees getting ready to
shoot with my imaginary gun, just in time to save Dragonfly
from being cooked. Dragonfly looked half crazy standing there
tied to the tree and with a grin on his face, watching Poetry
stack a little stack of sticks in one place for our imaginary fire.
We wouldn’t start a real fire on account of it would have been
absolutely crazy to start one, nobody with any sense starting a
fire in a forest on account of there might be a terrible forest fire
and thousands of beautiful trees would be burned, and lots of
wild animals, and maybe homes and cottages of people, and even
people themselves.</p>

<p>A jiffy after the stack of sticks was ready, Poetry set the big
prune can on top, then he turned to Dragonfly and started to
untie him.</p>

<p>“Groan!” Poetry said to him. “Act like
<a name="your" id="your"></a><ins title="Original has 'your'">you’re</ins> scared to death!
Yell! <em>Do</em> something!”</p>

<p>Dragonfly didn’t make a very scared black man. “There’s
nothing to be afraid of,” he said; and there wasn’t, I thought&mdash;but
all of a sudden there was, ’cause the very second Poetry had
Dragonfly cut loose and was dragging him toward the imaginary
fire, Dragonfly making it hard for him by struggling and hanging
back and making his body limp so Poetry had to almost carry him,
and just as I peered through the branches of my hideout and
pointed my stick at Poetry and was getting ready to yell, “BANG!
BANG!” a couple of times, and then rush in and rescue Dragonfly,
there was a crashing noise in the underbrush behind me, and
footsteps running and then a terribly loud explosion that sounded
like the shot of a revolver or some kind of a gun which almost<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
scared the living daylights out of me, and also out of the poor black
boy and the cannibal that was getting ready to eat him.</p>

<p>Say, when I heard that shot behind me, I jumped almost out
of my skin, I was so startled and frightened. Poetry and poor
little pop-eyed Dragonfly acted like they were scared even worse
than I was.</p>

<p>When you’re all of a sudden scared like that, you don’t know
what to say or think. Things sort of swim in your head and your
heart beats fiercely for a minute. Maybe we wouldn’t have been
quite so frightened if we hadn’t had so many important things
happen to us already on our camping trip, such as finding a little
kidnapped girl in this very spot the very first night we’d been up
here, and then the next night catching the kidnapper himself in a
spooky Indian cemetery.</p>

<p>I was prepared to expect almost anything when I heard that
explosion and the crashing in the underbrush; and then I could
hardly believe my astonished eyes when I saw right behind and
beside Dragonfly and Poetry a little puff of bluish gray smoke and
about seventeen pieces of shredded paper, and knew that some
body had thrown a firecracker right into the middle of our excitement.</p>

<p>“It’s a firecracker!” Dragonfly yelled at us, and then I had an
entirely new kind of scare when I saw a little yellow flame of fire
where the explosion had been, and saw some of the dry pine needles
leap into flames and the flames start to spread fast.</p>

<p>I knew it must have been one of the gang who’d maybe had
some firecrackers left over from the fourth of July at Sugar Creek.
Quicker even than I can write it for you, I dashed into the center
of things, grabbed up our prune can and in less than a jiffy had
the fire out, and then a jiffy later, I heard a <a name="scuffling" id="scuffling"></a><ins title="Original has 'scufflling'">scuffling</ins> behind me and
a grunting and puffing; and looking around quick, the empty prune
can in my hands, I was just in time to see Circus, our acrobat,
scramble out of Poetry’s fat hands, and in less than another jiffy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
go shinning up a tree, where he perched himself on a limb and
looked down at us, grinning like a monkey.</p>

<p>I was mad at him for breaking up our game of make-believe,
and for shooting off a firecracker in the forest where it might
start a terrible fire. So I yelled up at him and said, “You crazy
goof! Don’t you know it’s terribly dry around here and you might
burn up the whole Chippewa forest!”</p>

<p>“I was trying to help you kill a fat cannibal,” Circus said.
He had a hurt expression in his voice and on his face, as he added,
“Please don’t tell Barry I was such a dumb-bell,”&mdash;Barry being our
camp director.</p>

<p>I forgave Circus right away when I saw he was really trying
to join in with our fun and just hadn’t used his head, not thinking
of the danger of forest fires at all.</p>

<p>“You shouldn’t even be <em>carrying</em> matches, to light a firecracker
with,” Poetry said up at him.</p>

<p>“Every camper ought to have a waterproof matchbook with
matches in it,” Circus said. “I read it in a book, telling what to
take along on a camping trip. Besides,” Circus said down to us,
“we can’t play Robinson Crusoe without having to eat food, and
how are we going to eat without a fire?” I knew then that he’d
guessed what game we were playing and had decided to go along.</p>

<p>“We don’t need you,” I said. “We need only my Man Friday,
and a cannibal that gets killed&mdash;”</p>

<p>“And turns into a goat,” Poetry cut in and said.</p>

<p>“Only <em>one</em> goat would be terribly lonesome,” Circus said. “I
think I ought to go along. I’d be willing to be another goat.”</p>

<p>Well, we had to get Dragonfly’s initiation finished, so I took
charge of things and said, “All right, Poetry, you’re dead! Lie
down over there by that tree. And you, Dragonfly, get down on
your knees in front of me and put your head clear down to the
ground.”</p>

<p>“Why?” Dragonfly wanted to know, and I said, “Keep still.
My Man Friday doesn’t ask ‘Why?’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
Dragonfly looked worried a little, but did as I said, and bowed
his head low in front of me, with his face almost touching the
ground.</p>

<p>“Now,” I said, “Take hold of my right foot and set it on
the top of your neck&mdash;NO” I yelled down at him, “Don’t ask
‘<em>why</em>!’ JUST DO IT!” which Dragonfly did.</p>

<p>“And now, my left foot,” I ordered.</p>

<p>“That’s what the blackboy did in Robinson Crusoe, so Crusoe
would know he thanked him for saving his life from the terrible
cannibals, and that he would be willing to be his slave forever,”
I said to <a name="Dragonfly" id="Dragonfly"></a><ins title="Original has 'dragonfly'">Dragonfly</ins>. “Do you solemnly promise to do everything
I say, from now on and forevermore?” I asked, and when Dragonfly
started to say, “I do,” but got only as far as “I&mdash;” when he
started to make a funny little sniffling noise. His right hand let
loose of my foot, and he grabbed his nose and went into a tailspin
kind of a sneeze, as he ducked his neck out of the way of my foot
and rolled over and said, “I’m allergic to your foot,” which the
dead cannibal on the ground thought was funny and snickered,
but I saw a little bluish flower down there with pretty yellowish
stamens in its center, and I knew why Dragonfly had sneezed.</p>

<p>My Man Friday, in rolling over, tumbled ker-smack into the
cannibal and the two of them forgot they were in a game and
started a friendly scuffle, just as Circus slid down the tree, joined
in with them, and all of a sudden Dragonfly’s initiation was over.
He was my Man Friday, and from now on he had to do everything
I said.</p>

<p>Up to now, it was only a game we’d been playing, but a jiffy
later Circus rolled over and over, clear out of reach of the rest
of us, and scrambled up into a sitting position and said to us
excitedly, “Hey Gang! Look! I’ve found something&mdash;here at
the foot of the tree. <em>It’s a letter of some kind!</em>”</p>

<p>I stared at an old envelope in Circus’s hands, and remembered
that right here where we were was exactly where we’d found the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
kidnapped girl and that the police hadn’t been able to find the
ransom money, and that the captured kidnapper hadn’t told them
where it was. In fact, he had absolutely refused to tell them. We’d
read it in the newspapers.</p>

<p>Boy oh boy, when I saw that envelope in Circus’s hands, I
imagined all kinds of things, such as it being a ransom note or
maybe it had a map in it and would tell us where we could find
the money and everything! Boy oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!...</p>

<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>3</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">W</span><small>ELL</small>, when you have a mysterious sealed envelope in your
hand, which you’ve just found under some pine needles at the
base of a tree out in the middle of a forest, and when you’re playing
a game about finding buried treasure, all of a sudden you sort of
wake up and realize that your game has come to life and that
you’re in for an honest-to-goodness mystery that will be a thousand
times more interesting and exciting than the imaginary game you’ve
been playing.</p>

<p>We decided to keep our new names, though, which we did,
although we had an argument about it first. I was still Robinson
Crusoe, and Dragonfly was my Man Friday. Circus and Poetry
wanted us to call them the cannibals, but Dragonfly wouldn’t. “I
don’t want to have to worry about being eaten up every minute.
You’ve got to turn into goats right away. Besides, one cannibal’s
already been shot and is supposed to be dead.”</p>

<p>“You’d make a good goat yourself,” Circus said to me,&mdash;“a
<em>Billy</em> goat, ’cause your name’s Bill.”</p>

<p>But it wasn’t any time to argue, when there was a mysterious
envelope right in the middle of our huddle where we were on
the ground at the base of the tree where Circus had found it, so
Poetry said, “All right, I’ll be the goat, if you let me open the
envelope.”</p>

<p>“And I’ll be the other goat,” Circus said, “if you’ll let me
read it.”</p>

<p>“Let <em>me</em> read it,” Dragonfly said to me. “Goats can’t read
anyway.”</p>

<p>“You can’t either,” I said. “You’re a black man that doesn’t
know anything about civilization and you don’t know how to
read.”</p>

<p>So it was I who got to open the soiled brownish envelope,
which I did with excited fingers, and then we all let out four disappointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
groans, for would you believe it? there wasn’t a single
thing written on the folded white paper on the inside&mdash;not one
single thing. It was only a piece of typewriter paper.</p>

<p>Well that was that. We all sank down on the ground in
different directions and felt like the bottom had dropped out of
our new mystery world. I looked at Friday and he at me, and
the fat goat started chewing his cud, while our acrobatic goat
rolled over on his back, pulled his knees up to his chin, and groaned,
then he rolled over on his side and, my Man Friday lying right
there right then, got <em>his</em> side rolled onto, which started a scuffle,
making my Man Friday angry. All of a sudden he remembered
something about the story of Robinson Crusoe. He grunted and
said, while he twisted and tried to get out from under the goat,
“Listen, you&mdash;when Robinson Crusoe and his Man Friday got
hungry, they killed and ate one of the goats, and if you don’t behave
yourself like a good goat, we’ll&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Circus was as mischievous as anything and said, while he
rolled himself back toward Dragonfly again and laid his head on
his side, “Isn’t your name Friday?”</p>

<p>Dragonfly grunted and said, “Sure,” and Circus answered,
“All right. I’m sleepy, and there’s nothing better than taking a
nap on Friday,” which he pretended to do, shutting his eyes and
started in snoring as loud as he could, which sounded like a goat
with the asthma.</p>

<p>That reminded Poetry of something funny he’d read somewhere,
and it was about two fleas who were supposed to have lived
on the island with Robinson Crusoe and his Man Friday. Both of
these fleas had been chewing away on Crusoe and were getting tired
of him and wanted a change, so pretty soon one of them called to
the other and said, “So long, kid, I’ll be seeing you on Friday.”</p>

<p>I just barely giggled at Poetry’s story ’cause my mind was
working hard on the new mystery, thinking about the blank piece
of paper and why it was blank, and why was the envelope sealed,
and who had dropped it here, and when, and why?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
So I stood up and walked like Robinson Crusoe might have
walked, in a little circle around the tree, looking up at the limb
where Circus had been perched, and then at the ground, and at
Poetry, my fat goat, who right then unscrambled himself from the
rest of the inhabitants of our imaginary island, and followed me
around, sniffling at my hand, like a hungry goat that wanted to
eat the letter I had.</p>

<p>Abruptly Poetry stopped and said to me, “Sh!” which means
to keep still, which I did, and he said, “Look, here’s a sign of
some kind.”</p>

<p>I looked, but didn’t see anything except a small twig about
four or five feet tall that was broken off, and had been left with
the top hanging.</p>

<p>My Man Friday and the acrobatic goat were still scuffling
under the tree, and didn’t seem interested in what we were doing.
“What kind of a sign?” I asked Poetry, knowing that he was
one of our gang who was more interested in woodcraft than most
of the gang and was always looking for signs and trails and
things.</p>

<p>“See here,” he said to me, “this is a little birch twig, and somebody’s
broken it part way off and left it hanging.”</p>

<p>“What of it?” I said, remembering that back home at Sugar
Creek I’d done that myself to a chokecherry twig or a willow,
and it hadn’t meant a thing.</p>

<p>“But look which way the top points!” Poetry said mysteriously.
“That means it’s a signal on a trail. It means for us to go in the
direction the top of the broken twig points, and after awhile we’ll
find another broken twig, and whichever way it points we’re to
go that way.”</p>

<p>Say, did my disappointed mind ever come to quick life! Although
I still doubted it might mean anything. Right away, we
called the other goat and my Man Friday and let them in on our
secret, and we all swished along, pretending to be scouts, going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
straight in the direction the broken twig pointed, all of us looking
for another twig farther on.</p>

<p>We walked about twenty yards through the dense growth
before we found another broken twig hanging, but sure enough
we did find one, and this time it was a broken oak twig, and
was bent in the opposite direction we’d come from, which meant
the trail went straight on. Then we did get excited, ’cause we
<em>knew</em> we were on somebody’s trail.</p>

<p>My Man Friday was awful dumb for one who was supposed
to be used to outdoor life, though, ’cause he wanted to finish
breaking off the top of the oak twig and also cut off the bottom
and make a stick out of it to carry, and to take home with us
back to Sugar Creek when we finished our vacation. “For a
souvenir,” he whined complainingly, when we wouldn’t let him
and made him fold up his pocket knife and put it back into his
pocket again.</p>

<p>“That’s the sign post on our trail,” Poetry explained. “We
have to leave it there so we can follow the trail back to where
we started from, or might get lost,” which I thought was good
sense and said so.</p>

<p>We scurried along, getting more and more interested and excited
as we found one broken twig after another. Sometimes they
were pointing straight ahead, and sometimes at an angle. Once
we found a twig broken clear off and lying flat on the ground, at
a right angle from the direction we’d been traveling, so we turned
in the direction it pointed, and hurried along.</p>

<p>Once when Poetry was studying very carefully the direction
a new broken twig was pointing, he gasped and said, “Hey, Gang!
Look!”</p>

<p>We scrambled to him like a flock of little fluffy chickens
making a dive toward a mother hen when she clucks for them to
hurry to her and eat a bug or a fat worm or something.</p>

<p>“See here,” Poetry said, “&mdash;here’s where our trail branches off
in two directions&mdash;one to the right and the other to the left.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
And sure enough, he was right, for only a few feet apart were
two broken twigs, one an oak, and the other a chokecherry, the
chokecherry pointing to the right and the oak to the left.</p>

<p>“Which way do we go for the buried treasure?” Poetry asked
me, and I didn’t know what to answer.</p>

<p>Then Poetry let out a gasp and said, “Hey, this one pointing
to the right looks like it’s fresher than the other. We certainly
are getting the breaks.”</p>

<p>We all studied the two broken twigs, and I knew that Poetry
was right. The one pointing to the right looked a lot fresher break
than the one pointing to the left. Why, it might even have been
made today! I thought. And for some reason, not being able to
tell for sure just how long it had been since somebody had been
right here making the trail, I got a very peculiar and half-scared
feeling all up and down my spine.</p>

<p>“I wish Big Jim was here,” my Man Friday said. I wished
the same thing, but instead of saying it, I said bravely, “Who wants
Big J&mdash;” and stopped like I had been shot at and hit, as I heard
a sound from somewhere that was like a high-pitched trembling
woman’s voice calling for help. It also sounded a little bit like
a screech owl’s voice that wails along Sugar Creek at night back
home.</p>

<p>“’Tsa loon,” Circus said, and was crazy enough to let out a
long, loud wail that trembled and sounded more like a loon than
a loon’s wail does.</p>

<p>I looked at my Man Friday and at my fat goat to see what
they thought it was. Right away before I could read their thoughts,
there was another trembling high-pitched voice which answered
Circus. The second I heard it, I thought it <em>didn’t</em> sound like a
loon but like an actual person calling and crying and terribly scared.</p>

<p>You can’t hear a thing like that out in the middle of the
Chippewa Forest where there are Indians and different kinds of
wild animals and not feel like I felt, which was almost half scared
to death for a minute, although I knew there weren’t any bears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
or lions, but maybe only deer and polecats and coons and possums
and maybe mink.</p>

<p>“It’s NOT a loon,” I whispered huskily, and felt my knees
get weak and I wanted to plop down on the ground and rest.
I also wanted to run.</p>

<p>Then the call came again not more than a hundred feet ahead
of us, and as quick as I had been scared, I wasn’t again, for this
time it did sound exactly like a loon.</p>

<p>In a jiffy we all felt better and said so to each other. The newest
broken twig right beside us was pointing in the direction
the sound came from, so we decided there was probably a lake
right close by which is where loons nearly always are&mdash;out on some
lake somewhere swimming along like ducks, and diving and also
screaming bloody murder to their mates.</p>

<p>We all swished along, being very careful to look at the broken
twigs so we’d remember what they looked like when we got ready
to come back, which we planned we’d do after awhile.</p>

<p>My fat goat and I were walking together ahead of my Man
Friday and my acrobatic goat. We dodged out way around fallen
tree trunks and old stumps and around wild rose bushes and also
wild raspberry patches and chokecherries, and still there wasn’t
any lake anywhere.</p>

<p>It certainly was a queer feeling we had though, as we dodged
along, talking about our mystery and wondering where we were
going, and how soon we would get there.</p>

<p>“’Tsfunny how come Circus found that envelope back there
with only a blank piece of white paper in it,” I said. “Do you
s’pose the kidnapper dropped it when he left the little Ostberg
girl there?”</p>

<p>“I suppose&mdash;why sure, he did,” Poetry said.</p>

<p>“How come the police didn’t find it there then, when they
searched the place last week for clues. If it’d been there then,
wouldn’t they have found it?” I asked those two questions as fast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
as I could ’cause that envelope in my pocket seemed like it was
hot and would burn a hole in my shirt any minute.</p>

<p>Poetry’s fat forehead frowned. He was as struck as I was, over
the mystery.</p>

<p>All our minds were as blank as the blank letter and not a one
of us could think of anything that would make it make sense,
so we went on, following our trail of broken twigs. It was fun
what we were doing, and we didn’t feel very scared ’cause we knew
the kidnapper was in jail. In fact, we were all thrilled with the
most interesting excitement we’d had in a long time, ’cause for
some reason we were sure we might find something terribly interesting
at the end of the trail&mdash;if we ever came to it&mdash;not knowing
that we’d not only find something very interesting but would bump
into an experience even more exciting and thrilling than the ones
we’d already had on our camping trip&mdash;and one that was just as
dangerous.</p>

<p>Right that second we came to a hill. I looked ahead and spied
a wide expanse of pretty blue water down below us. Between us
and the lake, on the hillside, was a log cabin with a chimney
running up and down the side next to us, and a big log door.
We all had seen it at once I guess, ’cause we all stopped and
dropped down behind some underbrush or something and most
of us said, “Sh!” at the same time.</p>

<p>We lay there for what seemed like a terribly long time before
any of us did anything except listen to ourselves breathe. I was
also listening to my heart beat. But not a one of us was as
scared as we would have been if we hadn’t known that the kidnapper
was all nicely locked up in jail and nobody needed to be
afraid of him at all. I guess I never had such a wonderful feeling
in my life for a long time as I did right that minute, ’cause I realized
we’d followed the trail like real scouts and we’d actually run
onto the kidnapper’s hideout, and we might find the ransom
money. Boy oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!</p>

<p>Why all we’d have to do would be to go up to that crazy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
old-fashioned looking old house, push open a door or climb in
through a window and look around until we found it, I thought.
It was certainly the craziest looking weathered old house, and it
looked like nobody had lived in it for years and years. The windows
had old green blinds hanging at crooked angles, some of
the stones had fallen off the top of the chimney, and the doorstep
was broken down and looked rotten. I could tell from where I was
that there hadn’t been anybody going into that door for a long
time on account of there was a spider web spun from the doorpost
next to the old white knob, to one of the up-and-down logs in the
middle of the door.</p>

<p>“Let’s go in and investigate.”</p>

<p>“Let’s n-n-n-n-not,” my Man Friday said, and I scowled at him
and said fiercely, “Slave, we’re going in!”</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>4</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">E</span><small>VEN</small> though there was a spider web across the door, which
meant that nobody had gone in or out of the door for a long time,
still that didn’t mean there might not be anybody inside, ’cause
there might be another door on the side next to the lake.</p>

<p>Poetry and I made my Man Friday and the acrobatic goat
stay where they were while we circled the cabin, looking for any
other door and any signs of anybody living there. The only door
we found was one that led from the cabin out onto a screened front
porch, but the porch was closed-in with no doors going outside,
on account of there was a big ravine just below the front of the
house and between it and the lake. So we knew that if anybody
wanted to go in and out of the house he would have to use the
one and only door or else go through a window.</p>

<p>We circled back to Dragonfly and Circus, where we all lay
down on some tall grass behind a row of shrubbery, which somebody
years ago had set out there, when maybe a family of people
had lived there. It had probably been someone’s summer cabin,
I thought&mdash;somebody who lived in St. Paul or Minneapolis, or
somewhere, and had built the cabin up here. I noticed that there
was a cement pavement running all around the back side of the
cabin, which was set up against the almost cliff-like hill. Also
there was a very long stone stairway beginning about twenty feet
from the old spider-web-covered door and running around the edge
of the ravine, making a sort of semi-circle down to the lake to
where there was a very old dock, which the waves of the lake
in stormy weather, or else the ice in the winter, had broken down,
and nobody had fixed it.</p>

<p>We waited in our hiding place for maybe about ten minutes,
listening and watching before we decided nobody was inside, and
before we decided to look in the windows and later go inside,
ourselves. We didn’t think about it being trespassing, on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
of there was an old abandoned house back at Sugar Creek which
our gang always went into anytime we wanted to, and nobody
thought anything about it, because that old cabin back home belonged
to a very old long-whiskered old man whom everybody
knows as Old Man Paddler, and anything that belonged to him
seemed to belong to us, too, he being a very special friend of anybody
who was lucky enough to be a boy.</p>

<p>Anyway, we, all of us, were pretty soon peeking in through
the windows, trying to see what we could see, but it was pretty
dark inside, so we knew if we wanted to see more we had to
find some way to get in.</p>

<p>Right that second I decided to see if my Man Friday was
my Man Friday or not, so I said, “O.K., Friday, go up and knock
at that door.”</p>

<p>Say, Dragonfly got the scaredest look on his face. As you maybe
know, if you’ve read some of the other Sugar Creek Gang stories,
Dragonfly’s mother believed in ghosts, and good luck happening
to you if you find a four-leaf clover or a horseshoe, so Dragonfly
<a name="believed" id="believed"></a><ins title="Original has 'belived'">believed</ins> it too, most boys believing and doing what their parents
believe and do.</p>

<p>Dragonfly not only had a scared look on his face but also
a stubborn one, when he said, “I <em>won’t</em>!”</p>

<p>He refused to budge an inch, and so in a very fierce voice I
commanded Poetry and Circus, “O.K., cannibals, eat him up!”</p>

<p>“They’re NOT cannibals!” Dragonfly whined. “They’re goats,
and goats only eat tin cans and shirts and ivies and things like
that!”</p>

<p>“What’s the difference?” the fat goat said, and started head-first
for Dragonfly.</p>

<p>But we couldn’t afford to waste any time that way, so Poetry,
being maybe the bravest one of us, went up to the door, while we
held our breath, I knowing that there wasn’t anybody inside but
wondering if there was, and if there was, who was it, and was he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
dangerous, and what would happen if there was a fierce man in
there or something.</p>

<p>First Poetry brushed away the spider web, then he knocked
on the door.</p>

<p>Nobody answered the knock so he knocked again and called,
“Hello! Anybody home?”</p>

<p>He waited and so did we, but there wasn’t any answer, so
he turned the knob, twisting it this way and that, and the door
didn’t open. He turned around to us and said, “It’s locked.”</p>

<p>Well, I had it in the back of my mind that the ransom money
might be in that cabin and that we ought to go in and look, as
I told you, not thinking that it was trespassing on somebody’s property
to go in without permission.</p>

<p>We found a window on one side of the cabin right next to
the hill, which on that side of the house was kinda like a cliff, and
that window, when we tried it, was unlocked.</p>

<p>“You go in through the window and unlock the door from
the inside and let us in,” I said to my acrobatic goat, and he said,
“It’s private property.”</p>

<p>Right that second I felt a drop of rain on my face and that’s
what saved the day and made it all right for us to go inside. We
all must have been so interested in following the trail of broken
twigs and in our game of Robinson Crusoe that we hadn’t noticed
the lowering sky and the big thunderheads that had been creeping
up, for only about a few jiffies after that first drop of rain splashed
onto my freckled face, there was a rumble of thunder, then another,
and right away it started to rain.</p>

<p>We could have ducked under some trees for protection, but
it was that kind of rain that sometimes comes when it seems like
the sky has burst open and water just drives down in blinding
sheets, which it started to do.</p>

<p>“It’s raining pitchforks and nigger babies!” Circus yelled above
the roar of the wind in the trees. He quick shoved up the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
and scrambled in, with all of us scrambling in after him and
slamming the window down behind us.</p>

<p>The rain was coming down so hard that it made a terrible
roaring noise on the shingled roof, reminding me of storms just
like that back at Sugar Creek when I was in the haymow of
our barn. If there was anything I liked to hear better than almost
anything else, it was rain on a shingled roof. Sometimes when I
was in the upstairs of our house, I would open the attic door on
purpose just to hear the friendly noise the rain made.</p>

<p>It was pretty dark inside the old cabin on account of the walls
were stained with a dark stain of some kind, maybe to protect the
wood, like some north woods cabins are. It was also dark on account
of the sky outside was almost black with terribly heavy rain
clouds. I noticed that the window we’d climbed in was the kitchen
window and that there was a table with an oil cloth, with a few
soiled dishes on one side next to the wall. Also there was a white
enameled sink and an old-fashioned pitcher pump like the one we
have outdoors at our house at Sugar Creek.</p>

<p>The main room where the fireplace was, was in the center
of the cabin and was so dark you could hardly see anything clearly,
but I did see two big colored pictures on the back wall of the porch
at the front. I hurried out there, just to get a look at the storm,
storms being one of the most interesting sights in the world, and
they make a boy feel very queer inside, like maybe he isn’t very
important and also make him feel like he needs the One Who
made the world in the first place, to sort of look after him, which
is the way I felt right that minute.</p>

<p>I noticed that there was a sheer drop of maybe fifteen feet
right straight down into the ravine and remembered that if anybody
wanted to get out of the cabin by a door, he’d have to use
the only one there was which was the one that had been locked
when Poetry had tried the knob.</p>

<p>On the front porch where I was, were two or three whiskey
bottles, I noticed, and one with the stopper still in it, was half<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
full, standing on a two-by-four ledge running across the front.</p>

<p>I could see better out here, although the terribly dark clouds
in the sky, and also the big pine trees all around with their
branches shading the cabin, made it almost dark even on the porch,
but I did see two big colored pictures on the back wall of the porch
advertising whiskey, and with important looking people drinking
or getting ready to. Circus was standing with me right then, and
I looked at him out of the corner of my eye, remembering how
his pop used to be a drunkard before he had become a Christian,
but had been saved just by repenting of his sins and trusting the
Lord Jesus to save him. Say, Circus was looking fiercely at those
pictures, and I noticed he had his fists doubled up, like he wished
he could sock somebody or something terribly hard. I was glad
right that minute that Little Tom Till wasn’t there, on account
of his daddy was still a drunkard and a mean man.</p>

<p>I left Circus standing looking fiercely at those whiskey pictures,
and looked out at the lake which was one of the prettiest
sights I ever saw, with the waves being whipped into big white
caps, and blowing and making a noise which, mixed up with the
noise on our roof, was very pretty to my ears.</p>

<p>We didn’t even bother to look around inside the cabin for a
while&mdash;anyway, I didn’t. Away out on the farther side of the lake
there was a patch of sunlight and the water was all different
shades of green and yellow. Right away there was a terrific roar,
as a blinding flash of lightning lit up the whole porch, and then
it <em>did</em> rain, and the wind blew harder and whipped the canvas
curtains on the porch; and the pine trees between us and the lake
acted like they were going to bend and break. Six white birch
trees that grew in a cluster down beside the old outdoor stone
stairway that led in the semi-circle from the cabin down to the
broken-down dock, swayed and twisted and acted like they were
going wild and might be broken off and blown away any minute.</p>

<p>“Hey! <em>Look!</em>” Poetry said. “There are little moving mountains
out there on the lake!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
I looked, and sure enough that was what it did look like.
The wind had changed its direction and was blowing parallel with
the shore, instead of toward it, and other high waves were trying
to go at right angles to the ones that were coming toward the shore.
It was a terribly pretty sight.</p>

<p>All of a sudden while I was standing there, and feeling a
little bit scared on account of the noise and the wind and the rain,
I got to thinking about my folks back home, and was lonesome
as well as scared; and also I was thinking that my parents had
taught me that all the wonderful and terrible things in nature
had been made and were being taken care of by the same God
that had made growing boys, and that He loved everybody and
was kind and had loved people so much that He had sent His only
Son into this very pretty world, to die for all of us and to save
us from our sins. My parents believed that, and had taught it
to me; and nearly every time I thought about God, it was with
a kind of friendly feeling in my heart, knowing that He loved not
only all the millions of people in the world but also me&mdash;all by
myself&mdash;red-haired, fiery-tempered, freckle-faced Bill Collins, who
was always getting into trouble, or a fight, or doing something
impulsive and needing somebody to help me to get <em>out</em> of trouble.
Without knowing I was thinking outloud, I did what I sometimes
do when I’m all by myself and have that very friendly feeling
toward God. I said, “Thank You, dear Saviour, for dying for
me.... You’re an awful wonderful God to make such a pretty
storm.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know Dragonfly was standing there beside me, until
he spoke up all of a sudden and said, “You oughtn’t to swear
like that. It’s wrong to swear,” which all the gang knew it was,
and none of us did it, Little Jim especially not being able to stand
to even hear it without getting a hurt heart.</p>

<p>“I didn’t swear,” I said to Dragonfly. “I was just talking to
God.”</p>

<p>“You <em>what</em>?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
“I was just telling Him it was an awful pretty storm.”</p>

<p>“You mean&mdash;you mean you aren’t afraid to talk to Him?”</p>

<p>Imagine that little guy saying that! But then, he hadn’t been
a Christian very long and didn’t seem to understand that praying
and talking to God are the same thing, and everybody ought to
do it, and if your sins have been washed away, then there isn’t
anything to be afraid of.</p>

<p>I was aroused from what I’d been thinking, by my acrobatic
goat calling to us from back in the cabin saying, “Hey, Gang!
Aren’t we going to explore this old shell and see if we can find
the ransom money?”</p>

<p>That sort of brought me back from where for a few minutes
my mind had been.</p>

<p>I took another quick look at the little moving mountains on
the lake and pretty soon we were all inside where Circus had been
all the time looking around to see what he could find. But it was
too dark to see anything very clearly, and we didn’t have any
flashlight. I looked on a high mantel above the fireplace to see
if there was any kerosene lamp, but there wasn’t. There wasn’t
any furniture in the main room except a table, three small chairs
and one great big old-fashioned Morris chair like one my pop always
sat in at home in our living room. It had a fierce-looking
tiger head with a wide-open mouth on the end of each arm, which
gave me an eery feeling when I saw them, which I did right
away, when Circus lit one of the matches he had with him.</p>

<p>“Here’s a candle, out here on the kitchen table,” Dragonfly
said, and brought it in to where we were. It certainly was the
darkest cabin on the inside I ever saw. The walls were almost
black, and the stone arch at the top of the fireplace was black
with smoke where the fireplace had probably smoked when it had
a fire in it. There was only about an inch of the candle left.</p>

<p>Circus lit it while Poetry held it, and we followed Poetry all
around wherever he went. The noise of the storm and the dark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
cabin made it seem like we were having a strange adventure in
the middle of the night.</p>

<p>There were spider webs on nearly everything, and dust on the
floor, and it looked like nobody had lived here for an awful long
time, maybe years and years. Besides the front porch there were
just the three rooms&mdash;the kitchen with the sink and pitcher pump,
the main room with the fireplace and a smallish bedroom which
had a curtain hanging between it and the main room. In the
bedroom was a rollaway bed all folded up and rolled against a
wall.</p>

<p>Even though the broken twig trail had led us here, still we
couldn’t find a thing that looked like anything the ransom money
might have been hidden in.</p>

<p>So since the rain was still pouring down, we decided to call
a meeting and talk things over. We pulled the three stiff-backed
chairs up to the table in the center of the main room, and also
the big chair, which I turned sidewise, and I sat on one of the
wooden arms. Poetry set the short flickering candle in a saucer
in the center of the table, and I, being supposed to be the leader,
called the meeting to order, just like Big Jim does when the gang
is all present. It felt good to be the leader, even though I knew I
wasn’t&mdash;and Poetry would have made a better one.</p>

<p>We talked all at once, and also one at a time part of the time,
and not one of us had any good ideas as to what to do, except when
the storm was over to follow our trail of broken twigs back to
where the girl had been found and from there to the road and
back to camp.</p>

<p>I looked at Poetry’s fat face and at Dragonfly’s large eyes and
his crooked nose and at Circus’s monkey-looking face, and we all
looked at each other.</p>

<p>All of a sudden Poetry’s forehead puckered and he lifted his
head and sniffed two or three times like he was smelling something
strange, and said, “You guys smell anything funny, like&mdash;kinda
like a dead chicken or something?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
I sniffed a couple of times, and we all did, and as plain as
the nose on my face I <em>did</em> smell something&mdash;something <em>dead</em>. I’d
smell that smell many a time back along Sugar Creek when there
was a dead rabbit or something that the buzzards were circling
around up in the sky, or had swooped down on it and were
eating it.</p>

<p>Dragonfly’s dragonfly-like eyes looked startled, <a name="and" id="and"></a><ins title="Original has 'antd'">and</ins> I knew
that if I could have seen mine in a mirror, they’d have looked
just as startled.</p>

<p>“It smells like a dead possum carcass that didn’t get buried,”
Circus said, he especially knowing what they smell like on account
of his pop catches many possums and sells the fur. Sometimes on
a hunting trip when he catches a possum, he skins it before going
on, and leaves the carcass in the woods or in a field.</p>

<p>It was probably a dead animal of some kind, we decided, and
went right on with our meeting, talking over everything from
the beginning up to where we were right that minute&mdash;the kidnapping,
the found girl, the police which had come that night and
the plaster-of-Paris cast they’d made of the kidnapper’s tire tracks,
and the kidnapper himself which we’d caught in the Indian
cemetery, which you know all about maybe, if you’ve read the
other stories called “Sugar Creek Gang Goes North” and “Adventure
in an Indian Cemetery”....</p>

<p>“Yes,” Poetry said, “but what about the envelope with the
blank piece of typewriter paper in it?”</p>

<p>There wasn’t any sense in talking about that again, ’cause
we’d already decided it had maybe been left there by the kidnapper
who had planned to write a note on it and had gotten scared,
and left it, planning to come back later, maybe, or something.
Anyway, anything we’d said about it didn’t make sense, so why
bring it up again? I thought.</p>

<p>“That’s OUT,” I said. “I’m keeping it for a souvenir.” I had
it in my shirt pocket and for fun pulled it out and opened it and
turned it over and over in my hands to show them that it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
as white as a Sugar Creek pasture field after a heavy snowfall.</p>

<p>But say, all of a sudden as I spread it out, Poetry let out
an excited gasp, and exclaimed, “Hey! Look! There’s something
written on it!”</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my eyes, but there it was as plain as
day, something that looked like writing&mdash;scratches and longish
straight and crooked lines, and down at the bottom a crazy drawing
of some kind.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<hr class="divider" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
</div>
<h2><a name="v" id="v"></a>5</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">Y</span><small>OU</small> can imagine how we felt when we looked at that crazy,
almost illegible drawing on that paper, which, when we’d
found it, had been without even one pencil mark on it, and now
as plain as day there <em>was</em> something on it&mdash;only it wasn’t drawn
with a pencil or ink or crayon but looked kinda like what is called
a “water mark” which you can see on different kinds of expensive
writing paper.</p>

<p>All of us leaned closer, and I held it as close to the smoking
and flickering candle as I could, so we could see it better, when
Poetry gasped again and said, “Hey! It’s getting plainer. Look!”</p>

<p>And Poetry was right. Right in front of our eyes as I held
the crazy looking lines close to the candle, the different lines
began to be clearer, although they still looked like water marks.</p>

<p>Dragonfly turned as white as a sheet, with his eyes almost
bulging out of his head. “There’s a-a-a- <em>ghost</em> in here!” He whispered
the words in such a ghost-like voice that it seemed like
there might be one.</p>

<p>For a jiffy I was as weak as a cat, and my hands holding the
paper were trembly so, I nearly dropped it. In fact, as quick as a
flash, Poetry grabbed my hand that had the paper in it and pulled
it away from the candle or it might have touched it and caught fire.</p>

<p>Whatever was going on, didn’t make sense. My brain sort
of whirled and I sniffed again and thought of something dead,
and then of the writing that was on the paper and hadn’t been
before, and about Dragonfly’s idea that there was a ghost in the
old cabin, and I wished I was outside in the rain running lickety-sizzle
for camp, and getting there right away.</p>

<p>But it was Poetry who solved the problem for us by saying,
“It’s <em>invisible ink</em>, I’ll bet you. Its being in Bill’s pocket next to his
body made it warm, and now the heat from the candle is bringing
out what was written on it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
It took only a jiffy to decide Poetry was right, and as we
all looked at that crazy drawing, we knew we’d found a map
of some kind, and that if we could understand it, and follow
it, we would find the kidnapper’s ransom money.</p>

<p>Poetry took out his pencil and because the lines weren’t any
too plain in some places, he started to trace them, then he gasped
and whistled and said, “Hey, it’s a map of some kind!”</p>

<p>When he got through tracing it, we saw that it was a map
of the territory up here, with the different places named, such
as the Indian cemetery, the firewarden’s cabin, the boathouse,
two summer resorts, and the different roads and lanes running
from one to another, also the names of the different lakes on
one of which we had our camp.</p>

<p>We all crowded around the table, looking over Poetry’s
shoulders, and feeling mysterious and also a little bit scared, but
not much ’cause I was remembering that the kidnapper was
locked up in jail, and couldn’t get out.</p>

<p>“What’s that ‘X’ there in the middle for?” my Man Friday
wanted to know, and Poetry said, “That’s where we initiated
you,” and there was a mischievous grin in his duck-like voice.</p>

<p>“WHAT?” I said, beginning to get a let-down feeling.</p>

<p>Dragonfly burst out with a savage sigh, and said, “I might
have known there wasn’t any mystery. You made that map
yourself.” And was thinking the same sad thing, and said so,
but Poetry shushed us and said, “Don’t be funny; that’s where
Bill and I found the little Ostberg girl.”</p>

<p>“Yeah,” Dragonfly said, “but that’s also where Robinson
Crusoe stepped on my neck!”</p>

<p>“Oh, all right,” Poetry said, “That’s a dirty place on your
neck which needs washing.” But Dragonfly didn’t think it was
funny, which maybe it wasn’t very.</p>

<p>Just above the X a little distance, we noticed there was a
big V, a drawing of a broken twig, and a line pointing toward
the cabin where we were right that minute. Also there was a
line running from the top of the other arm of the V off in another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
direction and kept on going until it came to a drawing that looked
like a smallish mound; and lying across it was a straight short
line that made me think of a walking stick or something.</p>

<p>It didn’t make sense until I noticed that Poetry’s pencil had
missed tracing part of it, so I said, “Here, give me your pencil.
There’s a little square on the end of this straight line.”</p>

<p>I made the square, and then noticed there was a small circle
at the opposite end of the straight line, so I traced that, and the
whole map was done.</p>

<p>It was Circus who guessed the meaning of the square and
the circle I’d just made at the opposite ends of the straight line.
“Look!” he said, “it’s a shovel or a spade! That circle is the top of
the handle, and the square is the blade,” and we knew he was right.</p>

<p>And that meant, as plain as the nose on Dragonfly’s face,
that if we left this house and went back to where our trail had
branched off, and followed the broken twigs in that other direction,
we’d come to a place where the money was buried.</p>

<p>Boy oh boy, oh boy! I felt so good I wanted to scream.</p>

<p>It was just like being in a dream, which you know isn’t a
dream, and are glad it isn’t&mdash;only in dreams you always wake up,
which maybe I’d do in just another excited minute.</p>

<p>“Is this a dream or not?” I asked my fat goat, and he said,
“I don’t know, but I know how I can find out for you,” and I
said, “How?” and he said, “I’ll pinch you to see if there is any
pain, and if there <em>is</em>, it <em>isn’t</em>, and if there <em>isn’t</em>, it <em>is</em>.” He was trying
to be funny and not being, ’cause right that second he pinched me
and it hurt just like it always does when he pinches me, only
worse.</p>

<p>“Hey&mdash;ouch!” I said, and right away I pinched <em>him</em> so <em>he</em>
could find out for himself that the map wasn’t any dream, and
neither was my hard pinch on his fat arm.</p>

<p>The rain was still roaring on the roof, sounding like a fast
train roaring past the depot at Sugar Creek. We all sat looking
at each other with queer expressions on our faces and mixed-up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
thoughts in our minds. I was smelling the dead something or
other. The odor seemed to come from the direction of the kitchen
on account of it was on the side of the cottage next to the steep
hillside, which was as steep almost as a cliff, and right above its one
window I noticed there was a stubby pine tree growing out of
the hill, its branches extending over the roof.</p>

<p>Because the rain wasn’t falling on the window, I opened
it and looked out and noticed that water was streaming down
the hill like there was a little river up there and was pouring
itself down onto the cement walk and rippling around the outside
of the cabin. I thought for a jiffy how smart the owners of
the cabin had been to put that cement walk there, so the water
that swished down the hillside could run away and not pour into
the cabin.</p>

<p>It was while I was at the window that I noticed there was an
old rusty wire stretched across from the stubby pine tree toward
the cabin. I yelled to the rest of the gang to come and look, which
they did.</p>

<p>“’Tsa telephone wire,” Dragonfly said, and Poetry, squeezing
in between Dragonfly and me and looking up at the wire, said,
“I’ll bet it’s a radio aerial!” Poetry’s voice got excited right away
and he turned back into the kitchen and said, “There might be a
radio around here somewhere.”</p>

<p>With that he started looking for one, with all of us helping
him, going from the kitchen where we were, to the main room
where the fireplace was, and through the hanging curtains into the
bedroom, which had the rollaway bed in it, all folded up against
the wall; then we hunted through the screened porch, and looked
under some old canvases on the porch floor, but there wasn’t
any radio anywhere.</p>

<p>“There’s got to be one,” Circus said. “That’s an aerial, I’m
sure.”</p>

<p>Poetry spoke up and said, “If it is, let’s look for the place
where it comes into the cabin,” which we did, and which we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
found. It was through the top of a window in the bedroom. But
that didn’t clear up our problem even a tiny bit, on account of
there was only a piece of twisted wire hanging down from the
curtain pole and it wasn’t fastened to anything.</p>

<p>Well that was that. Besides what’d we want to know whether
there was a radio for? “Who cares?” I said, feeling I was the
leader, and wishing Poetry wouldn’t insist on following out all
his ideas.</p>

<p>“Goof!” he said to me, which was what he was always calling
me, but I shushed him, and said, “Keep still, Goat! Who’s the head
of this treasure hunt?”</p>

<p>He puckered his fat forehead at me, and half yelled above
the roar of the rain on the roof, “If there’s a radio, it means somebody’s
been living here just lately.”</p>

<p>“And if there <em>isn’t</em>, then what?”</p>

<p>It was Dragonfly who saw the edge of a newspaper sticking
out of the crack between the folded-up mattress of the rollaway
bed which was standing in the corner. He quick pulled it
out and opened it, and we looked at the date, and it was just
a week old. In fact, it was dated the day before we’d caught the
kidnapper, so we were pretty sure he’d been here at that same time.</p>

<p>Well, the rain on the roof was getting less noisy, and we
knew that pretty soon we’d have to be starting for camp. We
wouldn’t dare try to follow the trail of broken twigs to the place
where we thought the money was buried, because we had orders
to be back at camp an hour before supper time, to help with the
camp chores. That night we were all going to have a very special
campfire service, with Eagle Eye, an honest-to-goodness Chippewa
Indian, telling us a blood curdling story of some kind&mdash;a real
live Indian story.</p>

<p>“Let’s get going,” I said to the rest of us&mdash;“just the minute
it stops raining.”</p>

<p>“Do we go out the door or the window?” my Man Friday<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
wanted to know, and I took a look at the only door, saw that
it was nailed shut, tighter than anything.</p>

<p>I grunted and groaned and pulled at the knob, and then
gave up and said, “Looks like we’ll use the window.”</p>

<p>It was still raining pretty hard, and I had the feeling I wanted
to go out and take a last look at the lake. I’d been thinking
also if this cabin was fixed up a little and the underbrush and
stuff between it and the lake and a battered down old clock,
was cleared away, and if the walls were painted a light color, it
might make a pretty nice cabin for anybody to rent and spend a
summer vacation in, like a lot of people in America do do. On
the wall of the porch I noticed a smallish mirror which was dusty
and needed to be wiped off before I could see myself. I stopped
just a second to see what I looked like, like I sometimes do at
home, especially just before I make a dash to our dinner table&mdash;and
sometimes get stopped before I can sit down&mdash;and have to go back
and finish washing my face and combing my hair before I
get to take even one bite of Mom’s swell fried chicken.</p>

<p>I certainly didn’t look much like the pictures I’d seen of
Robinson Crusoe. Instead of looking like a shipwrecked person
with home-made clothes, I looked just like an ordinary “wreck”
without any ship. My red hair was mussed up like everything,
my freckled face was dirty and my two large front teeth still looked
too big for my face, which would have to grow a lot more before
it was big enough to fit my teeth. I was glad my teeth were already
as big as they would ever get&mdash;which is why lots of boys and
girls look funny when they’re just my size, Mom says. Our teeth
grow in as large as they’ll ever be, and our faces just sorta take
their time.</p>

<p>“You’re an <em>ugly</em> ‘mut,’” I said to myself, and then turned and
looked out over the lake again. Anyway, I was growing a <em>little</em>
bit, and I had awfully good health and nearly always felt wonderful
most of the time.</p>

<p>While I was looking out at the pretty lake, some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
same feeling I’d had before came bubbling up inside of me. For
a minute I wished Little Jim had been with us,&mdash;in fact, I wished
he had been standing right beside me with the stick in his hand
which he always carries with him wherever he goes, almost ...
I was feeling good inside ’cause the gang was still letting me be
Robinson Crusoe and were taking most of my orders. Sometimes,
I said to myself, I’d like to be a leader of a whole lot of people,
who would do whatever I wanted them to. I might be a general
in an army, or a Governor or something&mdash;only I wanted to be a
doctor, too, and help people to get well. Also I wanted to help
save people from their troubles, and from being too poor, like
Circus’s folks, and I wished I could take all the whiskey there
was in the world and dump it out into a lake, only I wouldn’t
want the perch and northern pike or walleyes or the pretty blue
gills or bass or sunfish to have to drink any of it, but maybe I
wouldn’t care if some of the bullheads did.</p>

<p>While I was standing there, thinking about that pretty lake,
and knowing that Little Jim, the best Christian in the gang, would
say something about the Bible if he was there, I remembered part
of a Bible story that had happened out on a stormy, rolling lake
just like this one. Then I remembered that in the story of Robinson
Crusoe there had been a Bible and that he had taught his
ignorant Man Friday a lot of things out of it and Friday had become
a Christian himself. My pop used to read Robinson Crusoe
to Mom and me at home many a night in the winter&mdash;Pop reading
good stories to us instead of whatever there was on the radio
that wouldn’t be good for a boy to hear, and my folks having
to make me turn it off. Pop always picked a story to read that was
very interesting to a red-haired boy and would be what Mom called
“good mental furniture”&mdash;whatever that was, or is.</p>

<p>All of the gang nearly always carried New Testaments in
our pockets, so, remembering Robinson Crusoe had had a Bible,
I took out my New Testament and stood with my back to the rest
of the cabin, still looking at the lake. I felt terribly good inside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
with that little brown leather Testament in my hands. I was glad
the One Who is the main character in it was a Friend of mine
and that He liked boys.</p>

<p>“It was swell of You to help us find the little Ostberg girl,”
I said to Him, “and also to catch the kidnapper, and it’s an awful
pretty lake and sky and ...”</p>

<p>Right then I was interrupted by music coming from back in the
cabin somewhere, some people’s voices singing a song I knew and
that we sometimes sang in church back at Sugar Creek, and it
was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line outdent">“Rescue the perishing, care for dying,</div>
<div class="line">Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>I guessed quick that one of my goats or else my Man Friday
had actually found a radio in the cabin and had turned it on. I
swished around, dashed back inside and through the hanging
curtains into the bedroom where I’d left them, when what to my
wondering eyes should appear but the rollaway bed opened out
and there, sitting on the side of it, my two goats and my Man
Friday and a little portable radio, which I knew was the kind
that had its own battery and its own inbuilt aerial. It was sitting
on my fat goat’s lap, and was playing like a house afire that very
pretty church hymn:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line outdent">“Down in the human heart, crushed by the tempter,</div>
<div class="line">Feelings lie buried that grace can restore.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>A jiffy after I got there, the music stopped and a voice broke in
and said, “Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program to
make a very important announcement. There is a new angle regarding
the ransom money still missing in the Ostberg kidnapping
case. Little Marie’s father, a religious man, has just announced
that the amount represented a sum he had been saving for the past
several years to build a memorial hospital in the heart of the mission
field of Cuba. In St. Paul, the suspect, caught last week at
Bemidji by a gang of boys on vacation, still denies knowing anything
about the ransom money; claims he never received it. Police<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
are now working on the supposition that there may have been
another party to the crime. Residents of northern Minnesota are
warned to be on the lookout for a man bearing the following description:
He is believed to be of German descent, a farmer by occupation,
about thirty-seven years of age, six feet two inches tall,
weighs one hundred eighty seven pounds, stoop-shouldered, dark
complexion, red hair, partly bald, bulgy steel-blue eyes, bushy
eyebrows that meet in the center, hook-nose....”</p>

<p>The description went on, telling about the man’s clothes, ears,
and mouth, but I didn’t need any more. My heart was already
bursting with the awfulest feeling I’d had in a long time, ’cause
the person they were describing was exactly like Old hook-nosed
John Till, the mean, liquor-drinking father of one of the Sugar
Creek Gang, little red-haired Tom Till himself, one of my very
best friends and a swell little guy that all of us liked and felt so
terribly sorry for on account of we knew that he had that kind
of a father, who had been in jail lots of times and who spent his
money on whiskey and gambling and Little Tom’s mother had to
be sad most of the time. In fact, about the only happiness Tom’s
mom had was in her boy Tom, who was a really swell little guy,
and went to Sunday school with us. She also got a little happiness
out of a radio which my folks had bought for her, and she listened
to Christian programs which cheered her up a lot.</p>

<p>Even while I listened to the radio on my fat goat’s lap, I
was thinking about Little Tom’s mom and wondering if she had
her radio turned on too, back at Sugar Creek, and would hear
this announcement, and if it would be like somebody jabbing a
knife into her heart and twisting it.</p>

<p>But we didn’t have time to think, or talk or anything, ’cause
right that second, I heard a noise coming from the direction of
the kitchen window, which we had climbed in, and when I took
a quick peek through the curtains, I saw the face of a fierce-looking
man. It only took me one second’s glance to see the bushy eyebrows
that met in the center just above the top of his hooked nose,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
and even though he had on a battered old felt hat that was dripping
wet with the rain, and his clothes were sop soaking wet, I recognized
him as Little red-haired Tom’s father.</p>

<p>In that quick flash of a jiffy I remembered the first time I
had seen him when he had been hired by my pop to shock oats,
and he had tried to get Circus’s pop to take a drink of whiskey
over by some elderberry bushes that grew along the fence row.
It had been a terribly hot day, and Circus and I had been helping
shock oats too. Circus’s pop hadn’t been a Christian very long,
and because I hated whiskey and didn’t want Circus’s pop to do
what is called “backslide,” I had made a terribly fierce fast run
across the field with Circus, to try to stop his pop from taking the
drink and had run kerwham with both of my fists flying straight
into Old hook-nosed John Till’s stomach, and a little later had
landed on my back under the elderberry bushes from a terribly
fierce wham from one of John Till’s hard fists. After that, the
gang had had a lot of other trouble with him, but we’d gotten
Little Tom saved, and Tom, being a pretty good Christian for
a little guy, had been praying for his pop every day of his life ever
since. But up to now it looked like it hadn’t done any good ’cause
his pop still was a bad man and caused his family a lot of heartache.</p>

<p>Talk about mystery and excitement. I knew Tom’s pop hated
us boys and also he was pretty mean to Tom for going to church
with us, and on top of that was mad at my folks for taking Tom’s
mom to church; and whenever he came into the house when she
had a Christian program on the radio, he would either make her
turn it off or he would turn it off himself.</p>

<p>I’ll have to admit that I was afraid of Old hook-nosed John
Till, and right that minute I didn’t feel very much like being
the leader of the gang, which for some reason seemed to be made
up of only four very small boys, all of a sudden. The only thing I
felt like leading in, was a very fast foot race out through the
woods and toward camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
“Quick!” I hissed to the gang. “There’s somebody looking
through the window. What’ll we do?” Before I could think only
half of those thoughts and say only half of that sentence, I saw
the man’s hand shove up the window, and one of his wet long
legs, which had a big wet shoe on the end of it, swung over the
window ledge, and he started squirming his long-legged self in
after it.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<hr class="divider" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
</div>
<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>6</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">W</span><small>ELL</small>, what can you do, when there isn’t a thing you can
think of, of doing? When you are looking through an opening
in a hanging curtain and see a mean man coming into your
cabin, and when you know there isn’t any door you can dash
through to get away? Poetry already had the radio shut off and
all of us were as still as scared mice, listening, and also all of us were
trying to peep through the opening in the curtain.</p>

<p>I noticed that John Till had a newish-looking fishing rod,
which he stood against the wall by a window, then he turned
his back, reached out of the window and bent his body over to
pick up something that he had left out there. A jiffy later I saw
what it was&mdash;a stringer of fish&mdash;what looked liked five or six big
walleyed pike, and an extra large northern pike, which he probably
caught out in the lake.</p>

<p>He lifted the stringer and I heard the fish go kerflippety-flop-flop
into the sink, then I heard the iron pitcher pump squeaking
like he was pumping water on the fish, maybe to wash the dirt
and slime off of them.</p>

<p>The curtain we were peeping through looked like it had
been made out of the same kind of material one of my mom’s
chenille bedspreads is made out of, and was kinda fuzzy on one
side. Even before I heard Dragonfly do what he did just then,
I was afraid he would do it. He had his face up close to the curtain
not far from mine, and all of a sudden he got a puzzled expression
on his face, his eyes started to squint, and his mouth
to open, and he made a quick grab for his crooked nose with
one of his hands.</p>

<p>But it was too late. Out came the cuckooest-sounding sneezes
you ever heard, which he tried to smother and didn’t; and like
it nearly always sounds when he sneezes, it was like a fourth-of-July
firecracker that didn’t explode but just went “<em>hisssss-sh-sh-sh</em>”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
instead. At that same instant John Till whirled around and looked
through the main room and at the curtain behind which we were
hiding. If it had still been raining terribly hard, he wouldn’t have
heard us, maybe, but Dragonfly’s sneeze seemed to have been
timed with a lull in the rain, ’cause in spite of the fact that it was
a smothered hissing noise, it sounded like it was loud enough to
be heard a long ways away.</p>

<p>John Till jumped like he had been shot at and hit, and I
expected most anything terribly exciting and dangerous to happen.</p>

<p>First I saw him take a wild look around like he wanted to
make a dash for a door or a window and disappear. He must
have thought better of it, though, ’cause he started pumping water
again and doing something to the fish he had caught, then he
fumbled at his belt and in a second I saw in his right hand a
fierce-looking sheath knife, just like the kind Barry carried. Its
wicked-looking blade was about 5 inches long and looked like
it could either slice a fish into steaks in a jiffy or do the same to
a boy. Not a one of us had any weapons except our pocket knives,
and also not a one of us was going to be foolish enough to start
a fight. If only we could make a dash for the door and get out&mdash;if
the door wasn’t nailed shut, I thought. Then we could run like
scared deer and get away.</p>

<p>But there wasn’t a chance in the world&mdash;not with a fierce
man with a fierce-looking hunting knife in his hand.</p>

<p>Then Big John Till’s voice boomed into our room and said,
“ALL RIGHT&mdash;WHOEVER YOU ARE&mdash;COME OUT WITH
YOUR ARMS UP!”</p>

<p>“What’ll we do?” Dragonfly’s trembling whisper asked me,
but I already had my arms up, and in a second he had his spindling
arms pointed in different directions toward the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Get ’em up!” I whispered to all of us, and I thought that,
if we got a chance, we’d make a dive for the open kitchen window
and head for camp terribly fast.</p>

<p>Poetry’s fat forehead was puckered with a very stubborn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
pucker, and before I knew he was going to do what he did, he did
it, which was&mdash;he yelled into the other room, “Come on out onto
the front porch and get us!” only, of course, we weren’t on the
front porch, and it didn’t make sense at all until a little later.</p>

<p>As you know, Poetry’s voice was changing, and part of the
time it was a bass voice and the other part of the time, it was a
soprano, on account of he was old enough to be what my pop called
“an adolescent,” which is what a boy’s voice is like when adolescence
happens to him. Part of what Poetry said was in a man’s voice and
sounded pretty fierce, but right in the middle of the sentence his
voice changed, and it was like a scared woman’s voice, the
kind that would have made Dragonfly think it was a ghost’s
voice, if he had heard it in the middle of a dark night in an old
abandoned house.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, Dragonfly sneezed again, and we
knew we were found out for sure. It must have been darker in the
room where we were than it was in the kitchen or something,
or else John Till really thought we were out on that front porch,
’cause all of a sudden he left the sink where he’d been pumping
water on his fish, and whirled around with his big knife in his
hand, straight out of the kitchen and through the main room,
dodging the table in the middle, and the Morris chair, and made
straight for the front porch.</p>

<p>It was our signal to make a dash for the kitchen and the
open window, which we did, Poetry letting the baby-sized radio
plump down on the rollaway bed, and even as I led the way to
the kitchen window in a mad dash, I noticed that the radio’s side
panel which he had closed, dropped down, which is what turns it
on.</p>

<p>Most of us got to the window at the same time almost. My
acrobatic goat grabbed the kitchen table, and shoved it into the
doorway between the kitchen and the main room so as to block
Hook-nose’s way if he tried to come back quick and stop us. Poetry
was out first, and then Dragonfly, and then Circus, and last of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
all, I, Robinson Crusoe, who in the split jiffy they were getting
out first, got a glimpse of the swell big stringer of fish John Till
had caught, and which were, right that second covered with water
in the sink. The large northern pike was especially very pretty and
I thought that before I left the North this summer, I’d want to
catch a big fish, have it mounted by what is called a taxidermist
and put it on the wall of my room back at Sugar Creek.</p>

<p>I didn’t understand why John Till&mdash;as soon as he found out
we weren’t out on that porch but had tricked him&mdash;didn’t come
dashing madly back and jump over the table in the doorway and
grab the last ones of us to get through the window, but he didn’t
and I was too scared to stop to find out why.</p>

<p>So we swished around the corner of that cabin, made four
dives in the direction we knew the broken-twig trail went, and
went dashing through the still-sprinkling rain, through the wet
shrubbery and under the trees that were dripping water like a
leaky roof, and headed for camp.</p>

<p>Boy, was I ever glad we had our trail of broken twigs to go by.
When we got to the first one, Dragonfly, whose feet were getting
pretty wet, like all of ours were, stopped and made a grab for his
nose, and I knew he was allergic to something&mdash;maybe to too
wet feet. When he’d finished his fancy sneeze, he said, sniffing
at something he couldn’t see, but which he knew was there, “I
still smell something&mdash;<em>d-dead!</em>&mdash;something in that direction over
there!”</p>

<p>I sniffed in the direction he pointed, and sure enough, there
was that same deadish smell, like we’d smelled in the cabin, only
this time it was mixed up with the friendly odor of a woods after
a rain.</p>

<p>My fat goat smelled in the same direction, and so did my
acrobatic goat, and we all smelled the same very unpleasant odor
of something dead.</p>

<p>“I wonder who it is,” Poetry said, and Dragonfly looked like
he was thinking about a ghost again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
And would you believe it? I heard music coming from somewhere&mdash;in
fact, from the direction of the cabin we’d come from,
and I knew it was the radio that had plopped open when my fat
goat had left it in a hurry, and though I couldn’t hear the words,
I recognized the tune, and it was, “Since Jesus Came Into My
Heart.”</p>

<p>Well, we hurried on, following our trail, tickled that we had
managed to get out so easy, but wondering to each other if Old
hook-nosed John Till had had anything to do with the kidnapping,
and if maybe he knew where the ransom money was, and why
he hadn’t come dashing back into the kitchen to catch us.</p>

<p>“I think I know why,” Circus said, “he’s just like <a name="my" id="my"></a><ins title="Original has 'may'">my</ins> dad was
before he was saved. He couldn’t even stand to see a bottle of
whiskey without taking a drink, and I’ll bet when he saw that
big half-empty bottle out on the porch he just grabbed it up and
started gulping it down.”</p>

<p>Then Circus, being a little bashful about talking about things
like that, like some boys sometimes are, looked up, and seeing
the limb of a tree extending out over where he was going to walk,
leaped up and caught hold of it with his hands and chinned himself
two or three times, while Dragonfly, who was beside him under
the leaves of that branch, let out a yell and said, “Hey, watch out!
Quit making it rain on me!” which is what Circus had done&mdash;the
leaves of that branch getting most of the water shaken off and a
lot of it falling on Dragonfly all over.</p>

<p>Well, we were in a pretty big hurry, so we all zipped on, talking
and asking questions and trying to figure out what on earth
the deadish smell was and also wishing we had all the gang with
us, and a spade, and had time to follow the other trail of broken
twigs and actually find the ransom money.</p>

<p>In a little while we came to the place where we’d first found
the envelop with the invisible-ink map in it. There we stopped for
half a jiffy, and looked all around to be sure we would remember
the place again when we came back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
About twenty minutes later, we came puffing into camp in
clear sunshiny weather, the sky having cleared off after the storm,
but we were as wet as drowned rats.</p>

<p>The very minute the gang saw us come sloshing up to our
tents, Big Jim called out, “Where on earth have you been?”</p>

<p>Well, we’d agreed to keep our secret a secret for awhile, anyway
not to tell Barry first, but to rest of the gang&mdash;all except Tom
Till. We might decide to tell John Till too, but we wouldn’t if
Big Jim said not to, on account of it might spoil Tom’s vacation
and he wouldn’t have any fun the rest of our camping trip.</p>

<p>Dragonfly answered Big Jim’s question in a mischievous voice
by saying, “Bill’s been walking on my neck, and Poetry and Circus
have been making soup out of me, and I am a Negro,” which
wouldn’t make sense to anyone who didn’t know about Crusoe,
his black Man Friday and the cannibals.</p>

<p>As soon as we could, we changed to dry clothes, and Big
Jim took command of us by saying, “O.K., boys, I’m in charge
of camp for the rest of the day. Barry got a terribly important
letter in the mail an hour ago, and he’s had to go to Bemidji.
He’ll be back in time for our Campfire get-together.”</p>

<p>Well, that was that. If there was anything I liked better than
anything else, it was to be alone with only our gang, when it
can be its own boss, even though we all liked Barry a lot and
would do anything he said any time.</p>

<p>“Bill’s <em>my</em> boss,” Dragonfly said.</p>

<p>I looked at Dragonfly and then at Big Jim, and winked.</p>

<p>Big Jim grinned back, and then said to all of us, “Let’s get
the camp chores done.” Then he gave commands to different ones
of us to do different things. Poetry and I had the job of burying
the entrails and heads of some fish which Barry’d caught, and
which had just been cleaned before he left,&mdash;that being the best
thing to do with fish heads and other parts of the fish that you
aren’t going to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
“The spade’s in Barry’s tent,” Big Jim said, and a minute later
Poetry and I were on our way up along the shore to the burying
place.</p>

<p>We hadn’t gone more than fifty yards when we heard somebody
coming behind us on the run, and it was Dragonfly, with
an excited face, who said, “You crazy goofs! You going to dig
for the treasure without letting me go along?”</p>

<p>“Why hello, my Man Friday!” I said pleasantly, and told him
what we were having to do. “Here&mdash;you carry the spade and do
the digging.” And Poetry said, “And you can carry these fish insides,”
and with that he handed him a smallish pail he’d been
carrying.</p>

<p>But Dragonfly wouldn’t, so I let him disobey for once. When
we got to the place, we saw all kinds of little mounds of fresh
dirt where other fish entrails had been buried. And then all of
a sudden Poetry said, “Hey, here’s fish heads scattered all over
the ground here!”</p>

<p>I looked, and sure enough, he was right. All around there
were old half-eaten bullheads, and the eyes and ugly noses of
walleyed pike and two or three spatulate-shaped snouts of big
northern pike.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Dragonfly said. “Somebody’s been digging them up”&mdash;and
then he grabbed his nose just in time to stop most of what
might have been several very noisy sneezes, and said, “I&mdash;<em>kerchew!</em>&mdash;I-smell&mdash;<em>kerchew!</em>&mdash;s-something
<em>d-dead</em>.”</p>

<p>Well, that was that, and I got a sinking feeling in my stomach,
’cause right away I knew that what we’d smelled back in the
mystery cabin, and around the outside, was maybe something like
this.</p>

<p>“It’s raccoons,” I heard a voice saying behind us, and recognized
it as Circus’s voice, his pop being a hunter as you know, and he
would know about coons’ habits.</p>

<p>“Big Jim sent me to tell you guys to bury’m deep, ’cause the
chipmunks and coons’ve been digging’m all up again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
Well, we buried our stuff very deep, each one of us doing a little
bit, but for some reason I wasn’t feeling very happy. I seemed to
feel that all the mystery and excitement we’d been having and
which had been getting more exciting every minute, was all made
out of our own imagination.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose that map with invisible ink on it was only
maybe showing somebody where a fish cemetery is?” Poetry
asked, and I felt terribly saddish inside. We all looked at each
other with saddish eyes, and felt even sadder.</p>

<p>“Then Tom’s daddy is only up here on a fishing trip, and
he’s maybe rented the old cabin from somebody for a while,” I said.</p>

<p>We went back to camp feeling terribly blue.</p>

<p>Well, after supper and when it got almost dark, it was time
for Eagle Eye’s blood curdling Indian story. We knew that he
being a Christian Indian, would tell us a Bible story too, which
is one reason why our parents had wanted us to come on this
camping trip in the first place. Every night before we tumbled
into bed, we would listen to a short talk from the Bible, and then
somebody would lead us in prayer. Sometimes somebody gave us
a talk about boys and what boys ought to know about themselves
and God, and how God expected everybody in the world to behave
themselves&mdash;things like that. Not a one of the gang was sissified
enough to be ashamed of being a Christian, and as you know, every
single one of us nearly always carried his New Testament with
him wherever he went.</p>

<p>We started our evening campfire, which was going to be what
is called an Indian fire. It was after Eagle Eye’s story that I found
out about Little Tom’s terribly sad heart, and I was even <a name="gladder" id="gladder"></a><ins title="Original has 'gladded'">gladder</ins>
than I was that he hadn’t been with us in the afternoon. I’ll tell
you about that in the very next chapter.</p>




<div class="chapter">
<hr class="divider" />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
</div>
<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>7</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">I</span> <small>THINK</small> I never felt so sorry for anybody in my life as I did
for Little red-haired Tom Till at the close of our camp fire that
night.</p>

<p>It was fun having our big Indian guest, Eagle Eye, whom
we all knew and liked very much, take charge of our meeting.
He showed us how to build an Indian fire, which was like this:
First he made a little wigwam of some dry tinder and slender sticks,
and also some larger sticks all stacked up in the shape of an Indian
tepee, with the top ends lapping over each other a little. Then
he had us boys drag five or six big long poles from a little shelter
nearby, where there was a place for keeping wood dry.</p>

<p>It was interesting to watch him ’cause just for fun he was
wearing real Indian garb, with a headband filled with long pretty,
different colored feathers, and clothes that looked like the kind
I’d seen in pictures of Indians in our school library.</p>

<p>As soon as the little wigwam fire was laid, but not started yet,
he took his bow and arrow and a board which he called a fire
board, and in almost no time had a smallish fire started. It was
a pretty sight to watch that little wigwam of tinder and sticks
leap into flame and the long reddish-yellow tongues of fire go leaping
up toward the sky. The smoke rose slowly, and spread itself
out over our camp and sort of hung there like a big lazy bluish
cloud.</p>

<p>Little Jim and I were sitting side by each, and Little red-haired
Tom Till was right across the fire from me. The ground
was still wet, so we were sitting on our camp chairs. It being a
little chilly, I had a blanket wrapped around me, and had it spread
out to cover Little Jim too, he being my favorite small guy of the
whole gang. For some reason whenever he was with me, I seemed
to be a better boy&mdash;or anyway, I wished I was. It was the easiest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
thing in the world to think about the Bible and God and about
everybody needing to be saved, and things like that, when Little
Jim was with us. And yet he was as much a red-blooded, rough-and-tumble
boy as any of the rest of us. I never will forget the
way he shot and killed a fierce old mad mother bear once down
along Sugar Creek&mdash;which story you maybe know about, if you’ve
read it in the book, “We Killed a Bear.”</p>

<p>“Here’s a good way to save labor,” Eagle Eye told us as soon
as our wigwam fire had burned down a little. He picked up
one of the long thick poles and dragged it to the fire and laid
the end of it right across the still burning wigwam. Then he
dragged up another pole and laid the end of it crosswise across
the end of the first one. Pretty soon he had the ends of all the
poles criss-crossed on each other on the fire with all the opposite
ends stretching out in all directions like the spokes of a wagon
wheel. Say, almost right away the big hot flames were leaping
up like Circus’s pop’s hungry dogs leaping up around a Sugar
Creek tree where they’ve treed a coon. It was certainly a pretty
sight.</p>

<p>“Pretty soon, when the ends of the poles are burned up, we’ll
push the poles up a little further,” Eagle Eye said, “and you won’t
have to chop them in short pieces at all. When you want your
fire to go out, at bed time, you just pull the poles back from the
fire and pour water on the ends.”</p>

<p>I looked across at my Man Friday, and he grinned back at me
and said, “I’d rather have <em>him</em> for my boss than&mdash;than Robinson
Crusoe himself,” which was maybe half funny, I thought.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow night, you use the same poles, and not have to
chop,” Eagle Eye explained.</p>

<p>Well, Eagle Eye wrapped his blanket around him and sat
down on a log and began his story, first taking out his Bible&mdash;he,
as you know, being a missionary to his own people.</p>

<p>Before he got started, though, Little Jim, who was cuddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
up close to me, under my blanket, whispered, “That pretty blue
smoke hanging up there, is like the pillar of cloud it tells about
in the Bible. When it hung above the camp of the people of
Israel, it meant God wanted them to stay there awhile, and when
it lifted itself up higher, it meant they were supposed to travel on.”</p>

<p>I’d heard that story many a time in Sunday school or church,
and liked it a lot. I didn’t understand it very well, though, not
until that very second when Little Jim, who had his eyes focused
on Eagle Eye as he opened his Bible and also at the blue cloud
of smoke, said to me in my ear, “I’ll bet the cloud was there to
show the people that God loved them and was right there to look
after them and take care of them.”</p>

<p>Imagine that little guy thinking that, but it seemed like maybe
he was right.</p>

<p>Then Eagle Eye told his story, which was a different kind of
story than we had expected. It was all about how his father had
been such a good father until he learned to drink whiskey, and
then one night he had gotten drunk and had driven his car into
a telephone pole away up at the place where the highway and the
sandy road meet&mdash;“You boys notice next time you’re there. There’s
a cross which the Highway Commission put there, to remind people
that somebody met his death there by a car accident.”</p>

<p>Eagle Eye stopped talking a minute, and I saw him fumble
under his blanket for something, and it was a <a name="handkerchief" id="handkerchief"></a><ins title="Original
has 'handerchief'">handkerchief</ins>, which
he used to wipe a couple of quick tears from his eyes. It was the
first time I ever saw an Indian with tears in his eyes, and it gave
me the queerest feeling, ’cause I realized that Indians were real
people after all, and could feel sad inside, and love their parents,
the same as anybody else God had made.</p>

<p>Then my eyes swished across the circle to where Tom Till
was sitting beside Big Jim, and I saw him swallow hard like there
was a big lump in his throat. He was just staring into the fire like
he wasn’t seeing it at all, but was seeing something or somebody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
very far away. I knew that if he was imagining anything about
Old hook-nosed John Till, his thoughts wouldn’t have to travel
very far, but only to an abandoned old cabin on a lake&mdash;only he
didn’t know that.</p>

<p>Then Eagle Eye brought something else out from under his
blanket, and the minute I saw it I realized it was going to be hard
for Tom to sit still and listen, but there it was&mdash;a great big whiskey
bottle with pretty flowers on its very pretty label. Eagle Eye held
the bottle up in the light of the fire for us all to see, and said,
“This is the enemy that killed my father. I found it half empty
in the car where he died. This bottle is responsible for my father’s
broken neck, his crushed head, and the broken windshield that
cut his face and neck beyond recognition.”</p>

<p>Eagle Eye stopped then, and took the bottle in both of his
hands, held it out and looked at it, and shook his head sadly.</p>

<p>While everything was quiet for a jiffy, with only the sound of
the crackling fire, and Little Jim’s irregular breathing beside me,
I noticed that Little Tom Till over there had both of his smallish
kinda dirty fists doubled up tight like he was terribly mad at
something or somebody.</p>

<p>Then Eagle Eye talked again and said, “The Evil Spirit, the
Devil, paints all sin pretty, boys, but sin is bad. All sin is bad,
and only Jesus can save from sin. You boys pray for my people.
Too many of them are learning to drink the white man’s whiskey.”</p>

<p>Well, the story was finished, and Barry wasn’t back yet, to
take charge of the last part of our campfire meeting, so I knew
Big Jim would have to do it. It was what we called Prayer Time,
and just before somebody was supposed to lead us in an outloud
<a name="prayer" id="prayer"></a><ins title="Original has 'prayed'">prayer</ins>, the leader asked questions around the circle, if any of us
had anything or anybody we wanted prayer for.</p>

<p>So Big Jim took charge and started by saying he wanted us
to pray for Big Jim himself, ’cause some day he might want to
be a missionary; Circus was next in the circle, so he spoke up and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
said, “Everybody thank the Lord for saving my dad from being
a drunkard.” The very minute he said it, I was both sad and glad,
and looked quick at Tom Till who was still staring into the fire,
with his fists doubled up. Dragonfly was next, and he said, “Pray
for my mother.”</p>

<p>Poetry frowned, trying to think, then said, “For new mission
hospitals to be built in foreign countries, like Africa and Cuba and
other places,” and when he said Cuba, his and my eyes met and
I knew what else he was thinking about.</p>

<p>It was Tom Till’s turn next, but he sat with his head down
and was looking at his doubled-up fists. I could see he was afraid
to say a word for fear his voice would break and he’d cry, so Big
Jim skipped him and it was Little Jim’s turn. He piped up from
beside me and said in his mouse-like voice, “Everybody pray for
Shorty Long back home.” I certainly was surprised, ’cause Shorty
Long was the new tough guy who had moved into Sugar Creek
territory last winter and had started coming to our school and had
caused a terrible lot of trouble for the gang. But that was like Little
Jim, praying for something like that.</p>

<p>Next it was my turn. I’d been thinking all the time while the
different requests were being made, and hadn’t decided yet just
what to ask for, but all of a sudden I remembered something my
red-haired bushy-eyebrowed, reddish-brown-mustashed pop prays
for, when he asks the blessing at our table at the house, and so
I said, “Pray for all the broken-hearted people in the world,” only
when Pop prays he always adds, “For a broken and a contrite
heart, O Lord, thou wilt not despise.”</p>

<p>For a while after I said that, and thought that, I was lonesome
for my folks&mdash;for my grayish-brown-haired mother and my swell
baby sister, Charlotte Ann, and our black and white cat and our
kind of oldish house and our big gray barn, and Pop’s beehives
and our potato patch, and also I wished, for just a second, that I
could stand and take just one big happy look at Sugar Creek itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
with the weedy riffle just below the old swimming hole and the
old leaning linden tree above the spring, and Bumblebee Hill, where
we’d first met Little red-haired Tom Till and his big brother, Bob,
and had had a fight and I licked Tom, and at the bottom of that
hill we had run kersmack into the fierce old mad old mother bear
and her cub, and to save himself and all of us Little Jim had shot
her.</p>

<p>Well, that was all our prayer requests, except Little Tom’s, and
Big Jim was going to be courteous enough not to ask him again,
so he wouldn’t be <a name="embarrassed" id="embarrassed"></a><ins title="Original has 'embarassed'">embarrassed</ins>, but right away Little Tom spoke up
and said, “Pray for my daddy, that he’ll come home again, and will
get a good job.”</p>

<p>Then that little guy picked up a stick that was in front of
him and reached out and shoved the end of it into the fire, where
it sent up a lot of pretty yellow sparks toward the blue smoke cloud
up there; and for some reason there was a thought flashed into
my mind like somebody had turned on a light in my head, and it
was that Little Tom’s request was already on its way up to God,
just like the sparks had shot up toward the sky, and I felt that
sometime God was going to answer and give him a swell daddy
just like Circus’s daddy was, after he was saved, and his mother
would be happy and the whole family could go to church together.
They would have enough to eat, and better clothes to wear, and
everything.</p>

<p>But it certainly didn’t look like the answer was going to come
very soon, though&mdash;what with John Till being described by a
radio announcer as maybe the one who had helped the kidnapper,
and right now maybe John Till knew where the ransom money
was buried, if it was&mdash;and if he got caught, I thought, he’d have to
go to jail and this time maybe he’d have to stay a terribly long
time&mdash;years and years.</p>

<p>Well, Eagle Eye gathered up all our requests like a boy gathering
up an armload of wood, and took them to God in some very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
nice friendly words, and handed them to Him to look over and to
answer as soon as He could and in the best way.</p>

<p>I felt good inside watching Eagle Eye pray&mdash;although I shut
my eyes almost right away. First he took off his big Indian hat
and I noticed he had a haircut like ordinary white men. He left
his blanket wrapped around him and shut his eyes, and just stood
there with his brownish face kinda lit up by the fire, and he talked
to the heavenly Father like they were good friends....</p>

<p>Then the meeting broke up, and pretty soon it was time for
us to go to bed. I had a chance to talk with Tom alone a minute,
though, just before we went to our separate tents. All of us were
as noisy as usual at bedtime, except Tom, and I noticed he still
had a sad expression on his face, so when I got a chance, I walked
with him to the end of the dock where we stood looking out over
the pretty shimmering waves of the lake under the half moon
that was shining on it, and I said, “’Smatter, Tom? Something the
matter?”</p>

<p>He just stood there, not saying a word for a minute until I
said, “You’re one of my best friends, Tom.” Then he answered
me very sadly, saying, “The mail boat brought a letter from Mother,
and she’s worried about Dad. He’s gone again and nobody knows
where he is.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know what to say for a jiffy, so I just stood beside
him thinking and feeling sorry for him, wishing his pop could
be saved like Circus’s pop and that the Till family would all be
Christians and go to church. I don’t know why I thought what
else I thought just then, but this is what I thought&mdash;something
I’d heard Old Man Paddler, back at Sugar Creek, say once, and it
was, “A lot of husbands are murdering their wives a little at a
time. Some day a lot of mean husbands are going to look down
into the coffins at their wives’ funerals and realize that by making
them sorry and not being kind to them, their wives died ten years
sooner than they should have&mdash;and that’s the same as murder.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
Old hook-nosed John Till was a murderer, too, I thought, as
well as a drunkard, and it made me feel more sorry for the grand
little red-haired freckle-faced guy who stood beside me.</p>

<p>Tom had put his back to me. Both of his hands were clasped
around the flag pole at the end of the dock, and he was just weaving
his body backward and forward and sidewise like he was nervous.
“Don’t worry, Tom,” I said, “you’ve got a lot of friends, and my
mother thinks your mother is swell.” Right then I got the surprise
of my life, when he said what he said. I hadn’t realized that this
little guy liked his wicked daddy a lot, too. This is what he said,
“There are a lot of crosses all over the country like the one Eagle
Eye told us about&mdash;just like the one they put up for his Indian
daddy&mdash;” Then Little Tom stopped talking and I heard him sniffle
and I knew it wasn’t on account of the breeze from the lake or
because he was allergic to anything. He liked his daddy and didn’t
want him to get drunk and have a car accident and get killed.</p>

<p>I felt terribly saddish, and at the same time a sort of wonderful,
feeling came bubbling up inside of me. Say, I liked that little guy
so much it <a name="actually" id="actually"></a><ins title="Original has 'acutally'">actually</ins> hurt inside my heart. I reached out like my
pop does to me sometimes, and put my arm halfway around him,
and before I knew I was going to do it I’d given him the same
kind of a half a hug Pop gives me and said, “Listen, Tom. I think
God’s going to answer Eagle Eye’s prayer for you.”</p>

<p>Then I left bashful as anything, and just stood there beside him
while he kept weaving back and forth with his hands still on the
flag pole, neither one of us saying a word; and the waves of the
lake made a friendly sound, lapping against the dock posts and
washing against the sandy shore.</p>

<p>Well, the gang was yelling from the tents for us to hurry
and come on and go to bed, so Tom and I started to walk back
to shore and toward the Indian fire. The fire was still alive although
the flames were kinda lazy, and the big blue cloud of smoke
that had been hanging above our camp was mixed up with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
night sky seemed to be gone. Tom and I stopped beside the
fire a minute and looked down into it. Then just like he’d done
before, he picked up a stick and shoved it into the coals, and a
whole lot of sparks came out and shot in different directions of
up, toward the sky.</p>

<p>“Hey you&mdash;Bill,” Big Jim called to me from his tent, “it’s your
turn to put out the fire&mdash;the water pail is here in Barry’s tent&mdash;”
which is what we had to do every night with our camp fires, pour
water on them, so there wouldn’t be any danger of them suddenly
coming to life in a wind and starting a forest fire.</p>

<p>It didn’t take me long to get the water pail, dip up some water
from the lake and pour it on that fire till there wasn’t even one tiny
spark visible.</p>

<p>Little Jim came out and went along with me as I made two
or three trips from the fire to the lake and back carrying water.
As you know, Little Jim had been sleeping in Big Jim’s tent, with
Tom Till, and also Barry Boyland. The rest of us&mdash;in fact, our
whole Robinson Crusoe gang&mdash;slept in the other tent&mdash;my two
goats and my Man Friday and me.</p>

<p>“There’s something I want to ask you,” Little Jim said to me
just as I was about to leave him at his tent.</p>

<p>“What?” I said.</p>

<p>“Can I play Robinson Crusoe with you tomorrow?”</p>

<p>I was dumbfounded, “What?” I said. “Who told you about&mdash;our
game?”</p>

<p>“I just guessed it,” he said, “when Dragonfly said you walked
on his neck and he was a Negro, and that they’d been trying to
make soup out of him.”</p>

<p>I wouldn’t promise him, ’cause I wasn’t sure what my Man
Friday and my two goats would think of the idea, but later when
my goats and my Man Friday and I were alone in our tent, we
talked it over and Friday said, “Let’s let him&mdash;and he can be <em>my</em>
slave.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
Poetry spoke up from his sleeping bag beside me and said,
“Let’s let ’im ’cause he didn’t get to help us find the little Ostberg
girl, and he wasn’t even with us when we caught the kidnapper
himself in the Indian cemetery!”</p>

<p>So that was that. We wouldn’t take Tom Till along, though,
on account of we didn’t want him to know his daddy was up here,
and might be mixed up with the kidnapping mystery. Also for
some reason it didn’t seem right to me to have Big Jim come along
and be our leader, when Robinson Crusoe had to be the leader
himself.</p>

<p>Boy oh boy! I could hardly wait till tomorrow!</p>

<p>For a long time I lay awake, in our dark tent, smelling the
smell of mosquito lotion and hearing the noise of Dragonfly’s
snoring and the regular breathing of Poetry and Circus, and thinking
a lot of things. I hadn’t said my prayers yet, and I was already
in my sleeping bag, with the zipper zipped up&mdash;although I’d prayed
with the rest of the gang around the fire when Eagle Eye prayed
outloud for all of us. But it kinda seemed like it had been a dangerous
day, as well as a very wonderful one, and God had taken
good care of all of us boys and that I ought to tell Him so. Of
course, I could just talk to Him without kneeling, like I sometimes
do, but this seemed like it was extra important, so very quietly
I zipped open my sleeping bag, squirmed myself into a kneeling
position, and while a mosquito sang on my right ear without
stinging me, on account of the ear had mosquito lotion on it,
I said a few extra special words to God, and wound up by saying,
“And please don’t let John Till murder Little Tom’s mother.
Please save him as quick as You can, and if there is anything I
can do to help You, let me know, and I’ll try to do it.”</p>

<p>A little later, while I was lying warm and cozy in my bag,
listening to Dragonfly’s crooked nose snoring away like a handsaw
cutting through a board, it seemed like there was kind of a warm
secret between God and me, and that it might not be very long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
until Tom would have a new daddy.... Then I dozed off into
sleep, and right away, it seemed, I was mixed up in the craziest
dream I ever was mixed up in. My dream was about hook-nosed
John Till, Little Tom’s pop, and it seemed he was all tangled up
in the kidnapping mystery. In the last part of the dream, John
had a bottle of whiskey in one hand and was standing beside the
sink in the old cabin, pouring the whiskey over a stringer of fish.
He kept on pouring and pouring&mdash;in fact, the whiskey bottle sort
of faded out of the dream and John was pumping the old iron
pitcher pump, which, quick as an eye-wink, was standing at the
end of the board walk in our back yard at Sugar Creek, and
whiskey instead of water was coming in big belches out of the
pitcher pump’s mouth, and was splashing down over the fish which
were in our water tank, where our cows and horses drank....</p>

<p>All of a sudden I noticed that the stringer of fish had all
changed and that there wasn’t a walleye or a northern pike among
them, but only big dark brown ugly bullheads, and they weren’t
on the stringer any more, but were swimming around and playing
and acting lively in our water tank filled with whiskey. Poetry
who has standing beside me in my dream said to me in my ear,
“Look, Bill&mdash;the whiskey’s changed all the fish into bullheads.”</p>

<p>It was a silly dream, and right that second I felt something
touching me in the ribs. I forced my stubborn eyes open a little
but couldn’t see anything on account of it was very dark in our
tent, but I did see a shadow of someone leaning over me, and after
such a crazy dream I was scared of who it might be. Then I
heard Poetry’s husky whisper right close to my face saying, “Hey,
Bill!”</p>

<p>“What?” I whispered up at him. My mind was all tangled
up with mixed-up ideas.</p>

<p>Poetry’s whisper back in my car was, “Let’s take a look at
the invisible-ink map. I just dreamed there was another line running
off in a different direction. Let’s hold a hot flashlight down
real close to it and see if there is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
I didn’t want to wake up&mdash;or rather, I did want to go back to
sleep again, but Poetry kept on whispering excitedly about his
dream, so I reached over to my shirt which I had hung on my
camp chair close by, and ran my hand into the pocket where I
had had the map. Say, I hadn’t any sooner got my hand inside
than a very scared feeling woke me up quicker’n anything, on
account of the map wasn’t in the pocket. “Hey!” I whispered
to Poetry, “it’s not in my pocket!”</p>

<p class="noi"><span style="visibility: hidden; display: none;">“</span><span class="p200">S</span><small>URE</small> it is,” Poetry said. “It’s got to be!”</p>

<p>“But it’s not!” I said, more wide awake than I usually am
when I am wide awake. I must have made a lot of excited noise
’cause right away Dragonfly stopped snoring, sneezed a couple of
times, and wanted to know what was going on, and why.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” my fat goat said to him. “We’re just looking for
something.”</p>

<p>“Well, for&mdash;! Look with your <em>eyes</em> instead of your <em>voices</em>,”
Dragonfly said, “I’m allergic to&mdash;<em>kerchew!</em>&mdash;to&mdash;<em>kerchew!</em>&mdash;to
NOISE!”</p>

<p>“It’s your own snoring that woke you up,” Poetry said to my
Man Friday. “Now go back to sleep.”</p>

<p>I certainly felt queer. “Somebody’s <em>stolen</em> it,” I said to Poetry.
I was running my hands frantically through all the pockets of
my trousers and my shirt and all the other clothes I’d had on during
the day.</p>

<p>We flashed the flashlight all around the tent and into every
corner, where the envelope might have fallen out of one of my
pockets. “We’ve <em>got</em> to find it,” Poetry said. “Where do you
suppose you lost it?”</p>

<p>“<em>Lost</em> it? Somebody’s sneaked in here and stolen it.”</p>

<p>“Hey!” Poetry said, like he had thought of a bright idea. “When
did you remember looking at it last?”</p>

<p>My thoughts galloped back over the evening, and the afternoon,
and I couldn’t remember.</p>

<p>“What pocket did you have it in last?” Poetry asked, and I
thought a jiffy, and said, “Why, my shirt pocket where I keep
my New Testament. I put it there when I&mdash;”</p>

<p>And then I stopped talking, gasped out loud. I’d thought of
something. “Maybe we&mdash;maybe it dropped out of my pocket back
there in the cabin when we were climbing out of the window.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
Then Poetry said, “Yeah, or maybe you left it out on the front
porch, and that’s why John Till didn’t come back to try to stop
us. Maybe he found it on the floor out there and picked it up&mdash;if
it was what he’d been looking for&mdash;”</p>

<p>My acrobatic goat came to life then, and groaned and turned
over and tried to go back to sleep. But Poetry was more excited
than I was. He said, “Bill Collins, we’ve GOT to find that map,
and I don’t think we lost it around here anywhere.”</p>

<p>“Let’s all go back to sleep,” my Man Friday said.</p>

<p>“Go ahead&mdash;who’s stopping you?” I said. In a jiffy I was
scrambling into my clothes, while Poetry was doing the same
thing, each one of us knowing what the other one of us wanted
to do.</p>

<p>In less than a little while we had on our clothes so we wouldn’t
get cold while we stepped outside into the kinda chilly night, like
nights are up North even in the summertime. We had our two
flashlights and were soon looking around the outside of our tent,
sneaking along as quietly as we could so as not to wake up any
of the rest of the gang in the other tent.</p>

<p>We flashed our flashlights on and off all around the circle
where we had been sitting at the campfire service, but there
wasn’t a sign of any envelope there. Then we looked all around
the lean-to where we had gotten the dry logs for Eagle Eye’s Indian
fire, but still didn’t find anything, so Poetry and I followed the
path up the shore to the fish cemetery and looked all around
where we had been digging to bury the fish heads and entrails.</p>

<p>“Maybe it fell out of your pocket when you were digging here,”
Poetry said, but there wasn’t a sign of what we were looking
for there anywhere either. It was just like looking for a needle
in a haystack when there isn’t any needle to look for.</p>

<p>“Will you <em>ever</em>!” Poetry exclaimed, tossing his light all around
in a circle at the newly-made fish graves. “The coons’ve already
been here,” which I could see they had. I flashed my flashlight
from place to place and off into the woods in a big circle and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
up into the trees but didn’t see a thing that looked like bright
shining eyes or pretty gray fur or a furry tail with black furry
rings around it, which is the kind of tails ring-tailed coons have.</p>

<p>From the fish cemetery we went out to the end of the dock
and back, then to our tent again. When we stopped in front of
the closed flap we listened, but my Man Friday and my acrobatic
goat were as quiet as mice, so we decided they were asleep.</p>

<p>“Do you know what?” Poetry said, and I said, “What?” and
he said, “I think we’d better go back up along the trail where we
were this afternoon to see if maybe we dropped it along there
somewhere.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t imagine us being able to find it at night, like that,
even if it was there. Besides, I still had the notion&mdash;in fact, a very
creepy feeling inside of me&mdash;that somebody must’ve sneaked into
our tent while we were asleep and stolen it out of my pocket.</p>

<p>“Well,” Poetry said, “when did you last <em>look</em> at it? When did
you last have it <em>out</em> of your pocket? Where were you when you
<em>last</em> saw it?” and I must confess that the last time I had seen the
envelope was when we were still in the cabin. I had shoved it
into my shirt pocket right beside where I kept my New Testament.</p>

<p>When I told Poetry that, he said, “O.K., then, when did you
last have your New Testament out of your pocket?”</p>

<p>Say, I gasped out loud when he said that like that, for I remembered
that I’d had my New Testament out of my pocket when
I was on the porch of the old cabin John Till was in, and had
been holding it in my hand while I was looking out across the
very pretty terribly stormy lake.</p>

<p>“You mean you haven’t looked at it since then?” Poetry asked
me, astonished, and I said, “No.” I was astonished even at myself,
but then of course we’d all decided not to tell the rest of the gang
but to keep it secret for a while, so that explained why I hadn’t
taken it out of my pocket. Eagle Eye hadn’t asked us to read
any verses out of the Bible, so I hadn’t even thought of opening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
my New Testament. If I had, I would no doubt have noticed that
the envelope was missing.</p>

<p>“O.K., come on,” Poetry said. “Let’s get going,” which we did,
swishing as fast as we could through the wet grass and along the
path that was bordered by the still wettish bushes, although the
late afternoon sun had dried things off quite a bit.</p>

<p>Down the shore we went, past the boathouse, up the steep
hill and along the sandy road, shining our flashlights on and off
as we went. I carried with me a stout stick, just in case we ran
onto anything or anybody that might need to be socked in order
to save our lives. As we swished along in the moonlight, using our
flashlights, I was glad there weren’t supposed to be any bears up
here, and that where we were camping there weren’t supposed to
be any wild animals except deer, polecats, raccoons, chipmunks and
maybe a few other more or less friendly wild animals, all of which
would be half scared to death if they saw us hurrying past carrying
flashlights.</p>

<p>When we came to the place where we had found the little
Ostberg girl, we flashed our lights all around and on the tree
Circus had climbed, and all around where my acrobatic goat’s fire-cracker
had started the little fire which we had put out in a hurry.
I even went over and picked up the empty prune can which the
cannibals had left, and which the goats hadn’t eaten, and looked
inside, knowing, of course, that the envelope wasn’t there.</p>

<p>“We’d better follow the trail of broken twigs down to John
Till’s cabin,” Poetry said. “Maybe it fell out of your pocket down
there some place.”</p>

<p>Say, I was scared to get anywhere near John Till, remembering
his big hunting knife, but I kept thinking all the time
what I had been thinking before, which was, “What if John Till
has found the map, and has gone to dig for the treasure? If the
police find him, with it in his possession, the newspapers’ll print
all the story, and the Sugar Creek Gang will get a black eye all
over the country. On top of that, Little Tom Till will be ashamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
to come to Sunday school or even to school; besides, if we can
save Old hook-nosed John Till from having to go to jail, he might
not ever have to go again.” But I knew that IF he had to go
once more, having been in jail a good many times in his life, he’d
maybe have to stay in ten or fifteen years this time. So if we
could stop him from finding the ransom money, it’d be a good
idea. Besides, the money was supposed to be used for a hospital
on a foreign missionary field, which made it seem important
that we find it ourselves.</p>

<p>When we came to the first broken twig, even as scared as
Poetry and I were we zipped on, using our flashlights till we came
to the next, and the next. In a little while, we were at the top of
the hill looking down at the moonlight on the lake. Between
us and the lake was the cabin where we had had all our excitement
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>“Hey, look!” Poetry said to me. “There’s smoke coming out
of the chimney!” And sure enough there was. We could see it
in the moonlight, rising slowly from the brick chimney top and
spreading itself out into a large lazy cloud just like the one
Little Jim had whispered to me about, that was hanging above
our heads and that had reminded him of the one that had been
above the camp of the people in the Bible, which meant that God
was right there looking after them and loving them and protecting
them.</p>

<p>For a minute, right in the middle of all that excitement I
got a warm feeling in my heart that God was right there with
Poetry and me and that He loved us and was looking after us,
and also we were doing the right thing.</p>

<p>“Look!” I whispered to Poetry, holding onto his arm so
tight he said, “Hey, not so tight&mdash;I <em>am</em> looking!”</p>

<p>Through one of the windows, we could see a flickering fire
in the fireplace. From where we were, we could see past the
kitchen window, but couldn’t see into it. Then I felt my hair
rising right up under my hat, for there was the shadow of a man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
just like he’d climbed out that window. Then a flashlight went
on and off real quick.</p>

<p>“SH!” Poetry said to me, ’cause I had gasped outloud. “He’s
coming this way.” Which he was, but only for a few feet till
he got to the corner of the cabin, then he turned and followed the
cement walk which led along the side of the house and down
the slope to the dock.</p>

<p>I could hardly believe my ears, but I had to, ’cause the man
was whistling a tune and it was “Old Black Joe,” which we sometimes
sang out of a song book at Sugar Creek school, and also
used different words to in our church, which were:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">
<div class="line outdent">“Once I was lost and way down deep in sin,</div>
<div class="line">Once was a slave to passions fierce within.</div>
<div class="line">Once was afraid to trust a loving God,</div>
<div class="line">But now my sins are washed away in Jesus’ blood.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p class="noi">Only I knew John Till wouldn’t be thinking of those words when
he whistled, but would be thinking of the Old Black Joe ones.</p>

<p>At the corner of the cabin, he came out in the moonlight
where we saw as clear as anything. He had a pair of rubber boots
on, a fishing pole in one hand and a big stringer of fish, which
looked like the very same stringer he had in the sink in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>“He’s going out to clean his fish,” Poetry said.</p>

<p>“And he’s got a spade, to bury the insides with,” I said,
noticing it for the first time.</p>

<p>We stood there glued to our tracks and holding onto each
other, wondering “What on earth!” We hardly dared move
or breathe ’cause the cement walk came in our direction first
before it turned to make its long half circle down to the dock
and the lake.</p>

<p>“Maybe he’s going down to put his fish in a live box,” Poetry
said, which is what fishermen sometimes do with their live fish
which they’ve caught, especially if you don’t want to clean and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
eat them right away. They keep them alive in what is called
a “live box” down at the lake near their docks.</p>

<p>“But they would have been dead by now,” I said. “They
wouldn’t stay alive in that sink all this time&mdash;not with all that
whiskey all over them,” and Poetry said, “What whiskey all over
what, where?”</p>

<p>Then I remembered that I had only dreamed about the whiskey
coming out of the pump and filling the sink, and I felt foolish,
but say, that dream had seemed so real that it was just like it
had actually happened.</p>

<p>John Till’s whistle sounded farther and farther away as he
went down the hill, and pretty soon we saw him coming out in
the moonlight on the dock away down at the lake.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Poetry whispered to me. “There’s a boat! He’s getting
into a boat,” which is what John was doing. In the next minute
and a half, with us standing up there with our teeth chattering,
partly because it was a cold and damp night and partly because we
were half scared half to death, we saw a flash of an oar blade in
the moonlight, and a little later the boat was shoved out from the
dock and we saw John Till rowing in the moonlight, going up
the shore.</p>

<p>Well, we didn’t know what was going to happen next, or
whether anything would, because it seemed like everything that
could possibly happen had already happened. But say, Poetry was
as brave as anything. Certainly he was braver than I was right
at that minute, or else we decided to do what we decided to do
in spite of being afraid. “Let’s go in the cabin and look around and
see if we can find the map,” Poetry said.</p>

<p>The very minute John Till’s boat disappeared around the
bend of the shore, we sneaked down the side of the hill, to the
kitchen window. We could see the flames leaping up in the fireplace.
In a jiffy Poetry had the window up and we had climbed
in. We could smell fish and also a sort of a deadish smell in the
cabin, but it was warm and cozy with the fire going in the fireplace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
We took a quick look in the bedroom and there was the
rollaway bed all nicely opened out with blankets on it and ready
for somebody to use.</p>

<p>We shined our lights in quick circles all over the floor, thinking
maybe John Till might not have known there was an envelope
which we might have dropped here. Then we went out onto the
front porch and looked very carefully in the direction his boat
had gone to be sure he was really around the bend and couldn’t
see our lights.</p>

<p>“Look!” Poetry said. “Here’s the whiskey bottle, standing
just where it was, and it’s still just as half full as it was!”</p>

<p>I looked and could hardly believe my eyes, but it was true.
“It must have had water in it instead of whiskey,” Poetry said, “or
John Till would have drunk it up the very minute he laid his
eyes on it.”</p>

<p>I put my nose close to the top of the bottle and smelled, and
sure enough it smelled just like whiskey, which is an even worse
smell than something that has been dead for a week.</p>

<p>I looked down at the place where I had been standing in the
afternoon when I had pulled the New Testament out of my pocket
to see if the envelope with the map in it was there, and it wasn’t.</p>

<p>Then we turned and walked back toward the door which led
into the main room.</p>

<p>When I got to the place where the mirror was on the wall,
I looked in it just to have a look at myself. I looked past my face
and away out onto the very pretty lake which was shimmering
like silver in the moonlight. Even though I didn’t have time to
think about how pretty it was, I remembered the happy feeling
I had had in my heart in the afternoon; and while Poetry and I
were going through the main room, past the fireplace and into
the kitchen and were climbing out of the window to go back to
camp, I thought that God could make just as pretty a moonlight
night as He could a thunderstorm. In spite of the fact that I was
all tangled up in a very interesting and exciting adventure, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
couldn’t help but be glad that I was on God’s side and that He
could count on me to be a friend of His anytime He needed me.</p>

<p>We didn’t have any trouble following our broken twig trail
to the place where it turned off in another direction. There we
stopped and Poetry said, “I wish we could follow this trail of broken
twigs tonight, and not wait till tomorrow. It might be too late
tomorrow. Do you know that it goes in the same direction John
Till’s boat was going?”</p>

<p>“What of it?” I said. My teeth were still chattering and I was
pretty cold and wet and also tired, and wished I was back in camp,
snuggled down in my nice warm cozy sleeping bag.</p>

<p>“We’d get lost in less than three minutes,” I said to Poetry,
“and then what would we do?”</p>

<p>“It’s as easy as pie not to get lost,” he said. “You stay right
here with your flashlight, and I’ll go in the direction the broken
twigs point until I find the next one; then you come to where I am
and stand there with your flashlight while I swish on to the next
one, and we can keep doing that from one to another until we get
there.”</p>

<p>“Get where?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Where the treasure is buried,” he said with an impatient voice.</p>

<p>“But we haven’t anything to dig with,” I said, in a voice just
as impatient.</p>

<p>We stood for a little while arguing with each other as to
what to do and whether to do it. “Let’s try it anyway!” Poetry
said. “You stay here till I go and see if I can find the next one.
Keep your flashlight turned off as much as you can, to save the
battery,” he ordered, and for some reason, I, Robinson Crusoe,
gave up and let my fat goat be the leader....</p>

<p>Away he went in a sort of a zig&mdash;zag style in the general direction
the broken twigs pointed.</p>

<p>I could hear him swishing around, up ahead of me. It felt
awful spooky here in this dark woods with my light turned off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
and only little patches of moonlight around me, coming through
the leaves and pine needles of the trees overhead.</p>

<p>After about four minutes, Poetry’s half bass and half soprano
voice called to me saying, “Hey, turn on your flashlight, so I can
find out where I am!”</p>

<p>I turned on my light, and shot its long beam in the direction
from which I had heard his voice, and he shined his toward me.
Then his half worried voice called and said, “Is your broken twig
pointing toward me?”</p>

<p>“No!” I said. “You’re off in a different direction. Why don’t
we get out of here and go home? I don’t think we can follow
any trail tonight.”</p>

<p>I knew it would have been easy if we had followed the trail
before in the daytime and had known what kind of broken twigs
to look for and how far apart they were.</p>

<p>Poetry didn’t like to give up, so when he got back to where
I was, he wanted to start out again, but I said, “What if we would
get lost out there somewhere?”</p>

<p>“We’d just follow the trail back again,” he said, but his voice
sounded like he had already given up. We decided to go back
to camp and get some sleep, and tomorrow we would come back
in broad daylight and be able to see where we were going.</p>

<h2><a name="ix" id="ix"></a>9</h2>

<p class="noi"><span class="p200">W</span><small>E</small> hurried back to camp as quickly as we could, sneaked
up to our own tent where my acrobatic goat and my Man Friday
were sleeping, and started undressing and getting into our pajamas.
I felt pretty saddish on account of the map being gone, but there
wasn’t anything we could do till morning.</p>

<p>We kept our flashlights turned off so as not to wake up the
other two guys. We could see a little on account of the moonlight
that was pouring down on the top of our tent.</p>

<p>“Where you guys been?” my Man Friday said to me from
behind me.</p>

<p>His voice scared me ’cause I’d thought he was asleep. “We’ve
been out looking for the invisible-ink map,” my fat goat answered
for me&mdash;“either somebody stole it out of Robinson Crusoe’s shirt
pocket, or we lost it back on the trail somewhere this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Oh, is <em>that</em> where you’ve been?” my Man Friday said. “Why
didn’t you tell me? I’ve got it here under my pillow. I was afraid
somebody would steal it, so I took it out of Crusoe’s pocket and
hid it here.”</p>

<p>“WHAT!” I said fiercely, more disgusted with him than I
had been for a long time. I made a dive for him, so half mad I
could have beat him up.</p>

<p>“Don’t hurt me!” he cried, turning his face and burying it in
his pillow, which, the minute he did it, his nose objected to it
by making him sneeze. “Your Man Friday&mdash;<em>kerchew!</em>&mdash;has to
look after you, doesn’t he?”</p>

<p>Well, that was that. Poetry and I were so tired and so sleepy
that we didn’t feel like telling Dragonfly and Circus what we had
seen going on up at the old cabin.</p>

<p>I got the map away from Dragonfly and put it down inside
my sleeping bag with me, next to my chest, happy that it wasn’t
lost, and feeling cozy and warm and glad to have a warm bed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
sleep in, and the next thing I knew it was morning. Our mystery
was still unsolved, but it was a very pretty wonderful sunshiny
day, with a pretty blue sky, and the lake was as smooth as a pane
of blue glass.</p>

<p>Little Tom Till was our main problem. Barry still hadn’t
come back, so Big Jim was in charge of us till noon. I’d promised
to let Little Jim play Robinson Crusoe with us today&mdash;but what
to do about Tom Till? I hated to tell him his daddy was up here
in the North Woods and that the police were looking for him.</p>

<p>“How’ll we get away without taking Big Jim and Little Tom
Till and without having them ask all kinds of questions?” I asked
Poetry who grinned and said, “’Tsas easy as pie. The rest of you
just sneak away without anyone noticing you, and I’ll leave this
note on Big Jim’s tent pole.”</p>

<p>Poetry had a note already written. It was in poetry and was:</p>

<div class="line outdent">“Please,&mdash;Big Jim and Little Tom Till&mdash;</div>

</div>
<div class="right pl4">(Signed) Robinson Crusoe, his Man<br />
Friday and his Three Goats.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It was an easy way for us to get away without having to explain
where we were going and why.</p>

<p>In only a little while we were gone, following the sandy road
toward the place where the week before Poetry and I had found
the little Ostberg girl, all of us explaining some of the mystery to
Little Jim as we went along, my Man Friday carrying the spade
we were going to dig up the money with, and Little Jim carrying
his stick and an empty gunny sack he’d found.</p>

<p>“What’s the gunny sack for?” Dragonfly asked him, and Little
Jim said, “We’re going after buried treasure, aren’t we?”&mdash;which
we were.</p>

<p>When we came to the place where we had built the imaginary
fire with which to cook Dragonfly, Little Jim got the cutest grin on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
his face and said, “Here’s where I come in.... Somebody shoot
me quick, so I can turn into a goat.”</p>

<p>“BANG!” I said to him, pointing my finger at him. “Now
you’re <em>dead</em>.”</p>

<p>Little Jim plopped himself down on the ground, then jumped
up and said, “Now I’m a goat.” He began to sniff at my hand like
a good goat. He surely was a swell guy and had a good imagination,
I thought&mdash;only for some reason our game had turned from
innocent fun to a very serious and maybe a dangerous game.</p>

<p>We followed our broken twig trail to where it branched off
in two directions, one of the trails going toward the cabin where
we’d seen John Till twice, and the other one going toward where
the ransom money was buried, we hoped.</p>

<p>“Which way first?” my Man Friday asked me, then got a
screwed up expression on his face, sniffed, and said, “Hey! there’s
that deadish smell again!”</p>

<p>Sure enough it was. I turned my nose in different directions
to see which way it was coming from, but couldn’t tell for sure.</p>

<p>“Come on!” my acrobatic goat said, “Let’s get going!” and
he and my fat goat started off on the trail we hadn’t followed
yet. There wasn’t any use for me to get peeved that they didn’t
wait for my orders before going ahead, so I said, “Sure, that’s
what <em>I</em> say,” and away we all went, Little Jim carrying his stick,
with a grin and also a very serious expression on his smallish face.
He held his stick like he was ready to sock anything that might
need socking and swished on up ahead of me so the three goats
could be together.</p>

<p>It was fun following the trail, and yet as we moved along from
one broken twig to another and to another, I was remembering
what a dangerous surprise we had found yesterday when we had
come to the end of that other trail.</p>

<p>It certainly wasn’t a straight trail, but kept zig-zagging in
different directions, but it seemed from the direction of the sun
that it was working around toward the lake again. Pretty soon we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
came to a hill and looked down and sure enough there was the lake
ahead of us, and away down at the foot of the hill we could see
through the heavyish undergrowth there was a building of some
kind. The broken wild plum twig where we were standing pointed
right straight toward the oldish building.</p>

<p>We stopped, surprised. I had expected to find a little mound
of some kind, or some markings on a tree or something, but certainly
not an oldish building.</p>

<p>In a jiffy we had out the invisible-ink map and were studying
it. There wasn’t anything on it that looked like a house.... “It’s
an old icehouse,” Poetry said, and it was&mdash;a dilapidated oldish
unpainted log icehouse&mdash;an icehouse being a building of some kind
that people up in the lake country build to store ice in it in the
winter-time, so that in the hot summer they can have plenty of
ice for their iceboxes.</p>

<p>“Our hot trail suddenly turned cold,” my fat goat said, trying
to be funny and not being very. It certainly wasn’t what I’d expected
to find.</p>

<p>“O.K.,” Little Jim said, “let’s go down and start digging.”</p>

<p>“In an icehouse?” my Man Friday said, astonished. “You
wouldn’t expect to find any buried treasure in a thousand blocks
of ice!”</p>

<p>“Why not?” Poetry said. “Most icehouses have as much sawdust
in them as they do ice. The money’s maybe buried in there
in the sawdust.”</p>

<p>Well that seemed to make sense, so we circled around and
came up to the icehouse on the side where there was the most
shrubbery and where we’d be the least likely to be seen by anybody
in case anybody was watching.</p>

<p>We stopped about twenty feet from the place and listened,
but didn’t hear a thing, and then I got a sort of a feverish feeling
in my mind. I felt like maybe we were actually going to find the
ransom money&mdash;a whole twenty-five thousand dollars in 10 and 20
and 50 dollar bills. Say, the mystery of playing Robinson Crusoe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
seemed like an honest-to-goodness reality. I felt mysterious and
afraid and brave at the same time.</p>

<p>“All right, come on, you three goats. Come on, Friday,” I
said, all of a sudden waking up to the fact that I was supposed
to be the leader. “Let’s go in and dig.”</p>

<p>The entrance was on the side opposite to the lake. The very
old heavy barn door was wide open on its rusty hinges, but there
were short boards stretched across the entrance like the kind some
people use to board up the entrance to the coal bin in their
basement.</p>

<p>I looked over the top of the highest board which was just
about as high as my chin, and didn’t see a thing inside except sawdust.
In a jiffy we had all scrambled up and were inside in the dark
icehouse, which didn’t have any windows and was only one big
room maybe 20 feet square. It seemed kinda like the haymow in
our barn at Sugar Creek, only instead of having nice alfalfa hay
in it, it had sawdust. Down underneath we knew there were scores
of big blocks of ice which somebody had cut out of the lake in
the winter-time and had stored away here for summer use.</p>

<p>The old icehouse was also about the same shape as the woodshed
beside our red-brick schoolhouse back at Sugar Creek, where
we had had many a gang meeting. I noticed that the only light
that came in was from the door which, as I told you, was boarded
up to as high as my chin, although there was a smallish crack
between two logs on the side next to the lake.</p>

<p>It only took a jiffy for our eyes to get accustomed to the darkness.
I looked around but couldn’t see anything but sawdust.</p>

<p>“Hey,” Poetry said all of a sudden from the other side where
he had gone to look around. “It looks like the sawdust has been
disturbed over here&mdash;like somebody had been digging here lately.”</p>

<p>Say, you can imagine how we felt. I could just see in my
mind’s eye Little Jim’s gunny sack stuffed with money and all
of us coming grinning happily back into camp, with Big Jim and
Little Tom Till and maybe Barry Boyland, looking at us with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
astonished eyes. Also I could imagine what “The Sugar Creek
Times” would print about us, and also how happy the Ostberg
girl’s daddy would be, so I said, “O.K., Friday, give me the spade.”</p>

<p>“Me dig,” Dragonfly said, “&mdash;me white man’s slave.” With
that he scrambled across to where Poetry was; but Poetry hadn’t
waited for him but was already down on his knees digging with
his bare hands, which is a good way to dig in sawdust.</p>

<p>Almost right away all of us were down on our knees digging
as fast as we could with our bare hands, only Little Jim was using
his stick to help him, and I was using the spade which I’d taken
away from Dragonfly, to shovel aside the pile of sawdust that I
was digging out of my hole.</p>

<p>My fat goat spoke up then, and said, “D’you guys know that
Minnesota is called the Gopher State?”</p>

<p>Pretty soon my spade struck something hard, and I felt a
thrill go through me. “Hey,” I said, “I’ve struck something!
I’ve found it!” expecting it to be a box or a smallish trunk or maybe
a fishing tackle box, like the kind the kidnapper had had the night
we caught him, which you know about if you’ve read the book,
“Adventure in an Indian Cemetery.”</p>

<p>Almost before I had the words out of my excited mouth, there
was a mad scramble of boys’ feet swishing across the sawdust from
different directions, and in a jiffy most of the rest of us were all
around me looking down into my hole to see what I had found.
I shoved my spade in and out a few times, but it didn’t sound
like it was striking a tin box or a trunk or anything.</p>

<p>“Listen!” I said, which we all did, but I couldn’t tell what it
sounded like.</p>

<p>“Let me get it out for you!” my acrobatic goat said.</p>

<p>I let him run his long right arm down into the hole. He
scooped out several handfuls of sawdust and then let out a disappointed
sniff and said, “You’ve struck ice, Robinson Crusoe! This
is an <em>ice</em>house!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
I put my own hand down in the hole and my fingers touched
something cold. I also pulled out a smallish piece of ice which my
spade had chipped off.</p>

<p>“Anybody else strike ice?” I asked, and right that second I
noticed Little Jim over in a corner, prying at something with his
stick, with his tongue between his teeth like he has it sometimes
when he’s working at something or other. He had a happy grin
on his face also, which I could see on account of he was facing
the opening where the light was coming in.</p>

<p>“What you got there, Little Jim?” I asked my blue-eyed goat,
and he said, “I don’t know. It’s all covered with sawdust.” Almost
before he’d said it, I saw two great big round glassy eyes, a very
large spatulate-shaped snout and a longish body that looked like
a small log of fireplace wood.</p>

<p>Poetry saw it at the same time I did, but thought quicker,
and exclaimed, “Hey, Gang! Little Jim’s dug up a terribly big
northern pike!”</p>

<p>Quick, we started to help him get it out of the hole, although
what we wanted to get it out for, I didn’t know. That buried fish
could mean only one thing and that was that <a name="somebody" id="somebody"></a><ins title="Original has 'somebdy'">somebody</ins> had caught
it in the lake and had dug down here in the sawdust till he had
reached the ice, and had laid the fish down on it, and covered it
up so it would keep cold and wouldn’t spoil like fish do almost
right away in warm weather, unless you put them on ice.</p>

<p>“Hey!” Dragonfly said. “I’ve found <em>another</em> fish over <em>here</em>!”
And he had.</p>

<p>We all stopped and looked at each other and I felt like the
bottom of my life had fallen out. Almost before I had thought
the next saddish disappointed thought, I’d said it to the rest of
the gang and it was, “So this’s what our mysterious map brought
us to. We should have known anybody wouldn’t be dumb enough
to leave a map right out in plain sight for anybody to find, if it
showed where to dig for any buried treasure!”</p>

<p>There certainly wasn’t anything unusual about digging up fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
in an icehouse anyway. We’d buried some in the icehouse at our
camp last year when we’d been up here, and then, a week later,
when we’d been ready to go home we’d dug them up and packed
them with sawdust and ice in a keg and taken them back to
Sugar Creek.</p>

<p>So that was that. We might as well go home, I thought, and
said so. “Let’s get out of here and go home, and keep still to everybody
about what fools we’ve all been and&mdash;”</p>

<p>But Poetry interrupted me by saying, “We’ll have to bury them
again, or they’ll spoil, and John Till’ll be madder than a hornet!”</p>

<p>“WHAT?” I said, and then remembered that we weren’t very
far from John Till’s cabin, and that we’d seen him coming right
this very direction last night in a boat, and that one of the fish
had been about the size of the one Little Jim had just dug up.</p>

<p>Thinking about John Till again made me decide it was time
for us all to get out of here in a hurry, so I started to dig with
the spade real quick to make Little Jim’s hole deep enough and
long enough all the way down so we could lay the big northern
pike’s whole length on the ice before covering it up.</p>

<p>“You bury yours again, too,” I said to Dragonfly, and he started
to dig his hole again, working as fast of he could.</p>

<p>Right that second Poetry, who was on his knees beside me, said,
“D’you ever see such a <em>fat</em>-stomached northern pike in your life?”</p>

<p>I stopped digging a half jiffy and looked at it, and never had,
except one I’d seen dead lying on a sandy beach once, and the flies
had been on it and it was bloated, but this one wasn’t bloated but
was like it had been caught only maybe yesterday.</p>

<p>In a little while I had the longish sawdust grave ready to lay
the fish corpse in it, when Poetry said to me in a hissing whisper,
“SH! BILL&mdash;feel here, will you? There’s something queer about
this fish’s stomach!”</p>

<p>The very excited sound of his whisper went clear through me
and made me feel like maybe he’d discovered something terribly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
important. I reached out my hands and felt where he was feeling
on the sides and stomach of the extra large northern pike, which,
even while I was doing it, I thought was about the same size as
the one I’d seen in the sink in the old cabin where John Till had
been pumping water yesterday.</p>

<p>Say, I could tell by my sense of touch that were <em>was</em> something
inside that fish that wasn’t a part of him.</p>

<p>“Look!” Poetry whispered to me again, using his fat right hand
to wipe off the sawdust from the bottom of the pike’s stomach.
“Here’s a place where it’s been sliced open, and sewed up again.
What do you s’pose it’s got in it?”</p>

<p>Well, you can guess what I was supposing, ’cause I was remembering
that yesterday in the old cabin I’d seen a big northern
the same size as this one, and that John Till had a big hunting knife
in his hand like the kind Barry uses to clean fish, and also I remembered
that last night in the middle of the moonlit night, we’d
seen John Till get into a boat with a stringer of big fish and row
up the lake in this direction.</p>

<p>Dragonfly must have been listening to Poetry and me, instead
of burying his fish like I’d ordered him, ’cause he spoke up and
said, “This one’s been cut open and sewed up again, too.”</p>

<p>Well, you can guess that we were an excited gang of treasure
hunters. Of course we didn’t know we’d found anything for sure,
but it certainly looked like we had. It wouldn’t take any more
than a jiffy and three-fourths to find out. Poetry took his knife
which was an official boy scout knife, and had a stag handle, a
heavy cutting blade, a screw driver, a bottle and can-opener and
a punch blade. He opened the sharp cutting blade and carefully
sliced through the heavy string the fish was sewed up with, and
right in front of our eyes&mdash;all the rest of the gang gathering
around to see what in the world&mdash;Poetry pulled out a big package
of something wrapped in oil paper, the same kind of oil paper
my mother has in our kitchen at home, which was waterproof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
In another second we had unwrapped the package and what
to my wondering eyes should appear but a packet of paper money
that looked like dozens and dozens of twenty dollar bills.</p>

<p>If I could have been somebody else standing close by and looking
down at me, I’ll bet I’d have seen my eyes almost bulging
out of their sockets with surprise and wonder and excitement.</p>

<p>“We’ve found it, Gang!” I said to us, and I knew we had.</p>

<p>Dragonfly piped up and said, “I’ll bet there’s a dozen other
big fish buried here with money in ’em.”</p>

<p>It was a wonderful feeling. First we’d found the invisible-ink
map, and then the trail of broken twigs, which we’d followed
in two different directions, and now we’d found the money itself.
Boy oh boy, oh boy! It was too good to be true!</p>

<p>“Now we know what the deadish smell was,” Dragonfly said,
but Little Jim said, “What deadish smell?”</p>

<p>Dragonfly answered, saying, “John Till took the fish’s insides
out while he was in the cabin, and maybe instead of burying them,
just threw them outside somewhere,” which I thought was pretty
sensible for Dragonfly to figure out.</p>

<p>But we couldn’t just stay here, and be like King Midas in
the fairy story every child ought to know, and count our money.
We ought to get back to camp and tell the gang and Barry and
let the whole world know what we’d found.</p>

<p>“Let’s get all of it dug up and take it away before John Till
finds out we discovered his hiding place,” Poetry said.</p>

<p>“But there might be a <em>dozen</em> other fish with money in them,”
I said, “and it won’t be safe to stay that long. It might take a
half hour to find all of ’em. We’ve got to get out of here quick
and get some help.”</p>

<p>Well, it certainly wasn’t any time to argue, with maybe the
whole 25 thousand dollars buried in the sawdust all around us.
But we did have to decide whether to take what we’d found and
beat it to camp, and come back with help, or to dig up all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
fish we could find right now, take the money out, shove it all into
Little Jim’s gunny sack and come happily back into camp with
every dollar of it.</p>

<p>Little Jim piped up with a bright idea which was, “Let’s dig
up all the fish real quick, stuff ’em in my gunny sack and beat
it home to camp, and take the money out on the way maybe&mdash;or
else take the fish home for dinner.” I looked at his excited
bluish eyes, and forgot that he was a goat, and thought how much
I liked him. “Boy!” he said, with a swell grin on his mouse-like
face. “Won’t Mr. Ostberg be tickled to have his money back for
the mission hospital!”</p>

<p>Here I’d been thinking about what a BIG reward I, Bill
Collins, was going to get for finding the money, and Little Jim
wasn’t thinking of himself at all, but of the folks in another land
who needed the gospel for their souls and a doctor’s help for their
bodies. What a swell guy, I thought.</p>

<p>But say, this story is long enough&mdash;and that’s really all of it,
anyway, that is, all about how we actually found the ransom money,
so I’ll have to wind up the whole thing in another paragraph or
two. That wasn’t all the exciting adventures we had on our
Northern camping trip, though, ’cause a new and very dangerous
adventure began to happen to us even before we got out of that
old icehouse that day.</p>

<p>While we were digging and finding fish with sewed-up
stomachs and stuffing them into Little Jim’s gunny sack, to take
home to camp, all of a sudden I thought I heard a noise outside.</p>

<p>“Sh!” I said to us. “Somebody’s coming!”</p>

<p>We all stopped stock still and listened, and sure enough I
<em>had</em> heard a noise. Out on the lake there was the sound of a high-powered
outboard motor that sounded like it wasn’t any more than
a hundred yards from shore.</p>

<p>I could imagine that somebody on the other side of the lake
had seen us and was coming roarety-sizzle across to stop whatever
we were doing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
Little Jim grabbed up his stick and Poetry’s grip tightened
on his scout knife handle till the knuckles on his hand turned
white, he was holding it so tight.</p>

<p>“Quick!” I said to all of us, “let’s get out of here with what
we’ve got, or it’ll be too late!”</p>

<p>I grabbed up the gunny sack, lugged it toward the exit, all
of us <a name="getting" id="getting"></a><ins title="Original has 'geting'">getting</ins> there at about the same time. Boy oh boy, if only
we could get out and make a dive for the woods and start to
camp without being seen.</p>

<p>But as I said, this story is already finished&mdash;and what happened
next is the beginning of another exciting adventure.</p>

<p>Even while we were climbing out of that icehouse I just knew
that long before we got home with our ransom money, there’d be
some dangerous excitement that would take not only a lot of
quick thinking on the part of every one of us, but some quick
<em>acting</em> as well. ’Cause the outboard motor was roaring toward
our shore like whoever was driving it was in a terrible hurry to
stop us from doing whatever we were doing.</p>

<p>I hope I’ll have time right away, to tell you this last story of
our adventures in the North Woods.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
