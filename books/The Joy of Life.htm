<h4><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h4>


<p>'La Joie de Vivre,' here translated as 'The Joy of Life,' was
written by M. Zola in 1883, partly at his country house at
Médan, and partly at Bénodet, a little seaside place in Brittany.
The scene of the story is laid, however, on the coast
of the neighbouring province of Normandy, between the
mouth of the Orne and the rocks of Grandcamp, where the
author had sojourned, more than once, in previous years.
The title selected by him for this book is to be taken in an
ironical or sarcastic sense. There is no joy at all in the
lives of the characters whom he portrays in it. The story
of the 'hero' is one of mental weakness, poisoned by a constantly
recurring fear of death; whilst that of his father is
one of intense physical suffering, blended with an eager
desire to continue living, even at the cost of yet greater torture.
Again, the story of the heroine is one of blighted affections,
the wrecking of all which might have made her life worth
living. And there is a great deal of truth in the various
pictures of human existence which are thus presented to us;
however much some people, in their egregious vanity, may
recoil from the idea that life and love and talent and glory
are all very poor and paltry things.</p>

<p>M. Zola is not usually a pessimist. One finds many of
his darkest pictures relieved by a touch of hopefulness; but
there is extremely little in the pages of 'La Joie de Vivre,'
which is essentially an analysis of human suffering and
misery. Nevertheless, the heroine, Pauline Quenu, the
daughter of the Quenus who figure largely in 'Le Ventre de
Paris' ('The Fat and the Thin'), is a beautiful, touching,
and almost consolatory creature. She appears to the reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
as the embodiment of human abnegation and devotion. Her
guardians rob her, but she scarcely heeds it; her lover
Lazare, their son, discards her for another woman, but she
forgives him. It is she who infuses life into the lungs of
her rival's puny babe; and when Lazare yields to his horrible
fear of death it is she who tries to comfort him, who
endeavours to dispel the gloomy thoughts which poison his
hours. No sacrifice is too great for her&mdash;money, love, she
relinquishes everything, in the vain hope of securing a
transient happiness for the man to whom she has given her
heart. At times, no doubt, she yearns for his affection, she
experiences momentary weaknesses, but her spirit is strong,
and it invariably triumphs over her rebellious flesh.</p>

<p>Lazare, on the other hand, is one of those wretched
beings whose number seems to be constantly increasing in
our midst, the product of our corrupt civilisation, our grotesque
educational systems, our restlessness and thirst for
wealth, our thousand vices and our blatant hypocrisy. At
the same time he is a talented young fellow, as are so many
of the wretched <i>décadents</i> of nowadays; and 'something
more or something less' in his brain might have turned his
talent into genius. In this respect, indeed, he suggests
another of M. Zola's characters, Claude Lantier, the painter
of 'L'&#338;uvre'; but he is far weaker than was Claude, whose
insanity sprang from his passion for his art, whereas Lazare's
mental disorder is the fruit of that lack, both of will-power
and of the spirit of perseverance, which always becomes manifest
in decaying races. Briefly, he is a type of the talented,
versatile, erratic weakling&mdash;a variety of what Paris expressively
calls the <i>arriviste</i>, who loomed so largely through
the final years of the last century, and who by force of
numbers, not of power, threatens to dominate the century
which has just begun.</p>

<p>In one respect Lazare differs greatly from Claude Lantier.
Claude's insanity drove him to suicide, but Lazare shrinks
from the idea of annihilation. His whole life indeed is
blighted by the unreasoning fear of death to which I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
previously alluded. In the brightest moments of Lazare's
existence, in the broad sunshine, amid the fairest scenes of
Nature, in the very transports of love, as in moments of
anxiety and bereavement, and as in the gloom, the silence,
and the solitude of night, the terrible, ever-recurring thought
flashes on him: 'My God, my God, so one must die!'
In the course of years this dread is intensified by the death of
his mother and his old dog; and neither of the women who
love him&mdash;the devoted Pauline, whom he discards, and the
puppet Louise, whom he marries&mdash;can dispel it. The pious
may argue that this fear of death is only natural on the part
of an unbeliever, and that the proper course for Lazare to
have pursued was to have sought the consolation of
religion. But they have only to visit a few lunatic asylums
to find in them extremely devout patients, who, whilst
believing in a resurrection and a future life, nevertheless
dread death quite as keenly as Lazare Chanteau did. Indeed,
this fear of dissolution constitutes a well-known and perfectly
defined disorder of the brain, rebellious alike to scientific and
to spiritual treatment.</p>

<p>By the side of Lazare and Pauline 'La Joie de Vivre'
shows us the former's parents. There is Lazare's mother,
who despoils and wrongs Pauline for his benefit, who lives
a life of sour envy, and who dies a wretched death, fearful of
punishment. And there is his father, whose only thought is
his stomach, and who, as I have mentioned, clings despairingly
to a semblance of life amid the direst physical anguish.
Louise, whom Lazare marries, is a skilfully drawn type of the
weak, pretty, scented, coquettish, frivolous woman, who seems
to have been with us ever since the world began, the woman
to whom men are drawn by a perversion of natural instincts,
and whom they need, perhaps, in order that in their saner
moments they may the better appreciate the qualities of
those few who resemble Pauline. As for the subordinate
characters of the story, the grumpy Norman servant, though
of a type often met with in M. Zola's stories, is perhaps the
best, the various changes in her disposition towards the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
heroine being described with great fidelity to human nature.
Then the rough but kind-hearted old doctor, the sturdy,
tolerant priest, the artful and vicious village children, are all
admirably delineated by M. Zola, and grouped around the
central figures in such wise as to add to the truth, interest, and
impressiveness of his narrative. And, painful as the tale at
times may be, it is perhaps as well, in these days of pride
and vanity, that one should be recalled now and again to a
sense of the abject grovelling which unhappily characterises
such a vast number of human lives. It may slightly console
one, no doubt, to remember that there are at least some
Paulines among us. But then, how few they are, and how
numerous on the other hand are the men like Lazare and
the women like his mother! When all is considered, judging
by what one sees around one every day, one is forced to the
conclusion that this diseased world of ours makes extremely
little progress towards real sanity and health.<br />

<h3>I</h3>

<p>When the cuckoo-clock in the dining-room struck six,
Chanteau lost all hope. He rose with a painful effort from the
arm-chair in which he was sitting, warming his heavy, gouty
legs before a coke fire. Ever since two o'clock he had been
awaiting the arrival of Madame Chanteau, who, after five
weeks' absence, was to-day expected to bring from Paris their
little cousin, Pauline Quenu, an orphan girl, ten years of age,
whose guardianship they had undertaken.</p>

<p>'I can't understand it at all, Véronique,' he said, opening
the kitchen-door. 'Some accident must have happened to
them.'</p>

<p>The cook, a tall stout woman of five-and-thirty, with
hands like a man's and a face like a gendarme's, was just
removing from the fire a leg of mutton, which seemed in
imminent danger of being over-done. She did not express
her irritation in words, but the pallor of her usually ruddy
cheeks betokened her displeasure.</p>

<p>'Madame has, no doubt, stayed in Paris,' she said curtly,
'looking after that endless business which is putting us all
topsy-turvy.'</p>

<p>'No! no!' answered Chanteau. 'The letter we had
yesterday evening said that the little girl's affairs were completely
settled. Madame was to arrive this morning at Caen,
where she intended making a short stay to see Davoine.
At one o'clock she was to take the train again; at two she
would alight at Bayeux; at three, old Malivoire's coach
would put her down at Arromanches. Even if Malivoire
wasn't ready to start at once, Madame ought to have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
here by four o'clock, or by half-past at the latest. There are
scarcely six miles from Arromanches to Bonneville.'</p>

<p>The cook kept her eyes fixed on the joint, and only shook
her head while these calculations were thrown at her. After
some little hesitation Chanteau added: 'I think you had
better go to the corner of the road and look if you can see
anything of them, Véronique.'</p>

<p>She glared at him, growing still paler with suppressed
anger.</p>

<p>'Why? What for? Monsieur Lazare is already out
there, getting drenched in looking for them: and what's the
good of my going and getting wet through also?'</p>

<p>'The truth is,' murmured Chanteau, softly, 'that I am
beginning to feel a little uneasy about my son as well. He
ought to have been back by this time. What can he have
been doing out on the road for the last hour?'</p>

<p>Without vouchsafing any answer Véronique took from a
nail an old black woollen shawl, which she threw over her
head and shoulders. Then, as she saw her master following
her into the passage, she said to him, rather snappishly:
'Go back to your fire, if you don't want to be bellowing with
pain to-morrow.'</p>

<p>She shut the door with a bang, and put on her clogs while
standing on the steps and crying out to the wind:</p>

<p>'The horrid little brat! Putting us to all this trouble!'</p>

<p>Chanteau's composure remained perfect. He was accustomed
to Véronique's ebullitions of temper. She had entered
his service in the first year of his married life, when she was
but a girl of fifteen. As soon as the sound of her clogs had
died away, he bolted off like a schoolboy, and planted himself
at the other end of the passage, before a glass door which
overlooked the sea. There he stood for a moment, gazing
at the sky with his blue eyes. He was a short, stout man,
with thick closely-cut white hair. He was scarcely fifty-six
years old, but gout, to which he was a martyr, had
prematurely aged him.</p>

<p>Just then he was feeling anxious and troubled, and hoped
that little Pauline would be able to win Véronique's affection.
But was it his fault that she was coming? When the
Paris notary had written to tell him that his cousin Quenu,
whose wife had died some six months previously, had just
died also, charging him in his will with the guardianship of
his little daughter, he had not felt able to refuse the trust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
It was true they had not seen much of one another, as the
family had been dispersed. Chanteau's father, after leaving
the South and wandering all over France as a journeyman
carpenter, had established a timber-yard at Caen; while, on
the other hand, Quenu, at his mother's death, had gone to
Paris, where one of his uncles had subsequently given him a
flourishing pork-butcher's business, in the very centre of the
market district.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> They had only met each other some two or
three times, on occasions when Chanteau had been compelled
by his gout to quit his business and repair to Paris for
special medical advice. But the two men had ever had a
genuine respect for one another, and the dying father had
probably thought that the sea air would be beneficial to his
daughter. The girl, too, as the heiress of the pork-butcher's
business, would certainly be no charge upon them. Madame
Chanteau, indeed, had fallen so heartily into the scheme that
she had insisted upon saving her husband all the dangerous
fatigue of the journey to Paris. Setting off alone and
bustling about she had settled everything, in her perpetual
craving for activity; and Chanteau was quite contented so
long as his wife was pleased.</p>

<p>But what could be detaining the pair of them? Anxiety
seized him again, as he looked out upon the dark sky, over
which the west wind was driving huge masses of black
clouds, like sooty rags whose tattered ends draggled far away
into the sea. It was one of those March gales, when the
equinoctial tides beat furiously upon the shores. The flux
was only just setting in, and all that could be seen of it was
a thin white bar of foam, far away towards the horizon.
The wide expanse of bare beach, a league of rocks and gloomy
seaweed, its level surface blotched here and there with dark
pools, had a weirdly melancholy aspect as it lay stretched out
beneath the quickly increasing darkness that fell from the
black clouds scudding across the skies.</p>

<p>'Perhaps the wind has overturned them into some ditch,'
murmured Chanteau.</p>

<p>He felt constrained to go out and look. He opened the
glass door, and ventured in his list-slippers on to the
gravelled terrace which commanded a view of the village.
A few drops of rain were dashed against his face by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
hurricane, and a terrific gust made his thick blue woollen
dressing-jacket flap and flap again. But he struggled on,
bareheaded and bending down, and at last reached the parapet,
over which he leaned while glancing at the road that ran
beneath. This road descended between two steep cliffs, and
looked almost as though it had been hewn out of the solid
rock to afford a resting-place for the twenty or thirty hovels
of which Bonneville consisted. Every tide threatened to hurl
the houses from their narrow shingle-strewn anchorage and
crush them against the rocky cliff. To the left there was a
little landing-place, a mere strip of sand, whither amid
rhythmic calls men hoisted up some half-score boats. The
inhabitants did not number more than a couple of hundred
souls. They made a bare living out of the sea, clinging to
their native rocks with all the unreasoning persistence of
limpets. And on the cliffs above their miserable roofs,
which every winter were battered by the storms, there was
nothing to be seen except the church, standing about half-way
up on the right, and the Chanteaus' house across the
cleft on the other hand. Bonneville contained nothing more.</p>

<p>'What dreadful weather it is!' cried a voice.</p>

<p>Chanteau raised his head and recognised the priest, Abbé
Horteur, a thick-set man of peasant-like build, whose red
hair was still unsilvered by his fifty years. He used a plot
of graveyard land in front of the church as a vegetable
garden, and was now examining his early salad plants, tucking
his cassock the while between his legs in order to prevent the
wind from blowing it over his head. Chanteau, who could
not make himself heard amidst the roaring of the gale,
contented himself with waving his hand.</p>

<p>'They are doing right in getting their boats up, I think,'
shouted the priest.</p>

<p>But just then a gust of wind caught hold of his cassock
and wrapt it round his head, so he fled for refuge behind the
church.</p>

<p>Chanteau turned round to escape the violence of the blast.
With his eyes streaming with moisture he cast a glance at
his garden, over which the spray was sweeping, and the brick-built
two-storeyed house with five windows, whose shutters
seemed in imminent danger of being torn away from their
fastenings. When the sudden squall had subsided, he bent
down again to look at the road; and just at that moment
Véronique returned. She shook her hands at him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>'What! you have actually come out!&mdash;Be good enough
to go into the house again at once, sir!'</p>

<p>She caught him up in the passage, and scolded him like
a child detected in wrong-doing. Wouldn't she have all the
trouble of looking after him in the morning when he suffered
agonies of pain from his indiscretion?</p>

<p>'Have you seen nothing of them?' he asked, submissively.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, I have seen nothing&mdash;Madame is no doubt
taking shelter somewhere.'</p>

<p>He dared not tell her that she should have gone further
on. However, he was now beginning to feel especially
anxious about his son.</p>

<p>'I saw that all the neighbourhood was being blown into
the air,' continued the cook. 'They are quite afraid of being
done for this time. Last September the Cuches' house was
cracked from top to bottom, and Prouane, who was going up
to the church to ring the <i>Angelus</i>, has just told me that he
is sure it will topple over before morning.'</p>

<p>Just as she spoke a big lad of nineteen sprang up the
three steps before the door. He had a spreading brow and
sparkling eyes, and a fine chestnut down fringed his long oval
face.</p>

<p>'Ah! here's Lazare at last!' said Chanteau, feeling much
relieved. 'How wet you are, my poor boy!'</p>

<p>In the passage the young man hung his hooded cloak,
which was quite saturated with sea-water.</p>

<p>'Well?' interrogated his father.</p>

<p>'I can see nothing of them,' replied Lazare. 'I have
been as far as Verchemont, and waited under the shed at the
inn there, and kept my eyes on the road, which is a river of
mud. But I could see no sign of them. Then, as I began
to feel afraid that you might get uneasy about me, I came
back.'</p>

<p>The previous August Lazare had left the College of Caen,
after gaining his Bachelor's degree; and for the last eight
months he had been roaming about the cliffs, unable to make
any choice of a profession, for he only felt enthusiastic about
music, a predisposition which distressed his mother extremely.
She had gone away very much displeased with him, as he
had refused to accompany her to Paris, where she had
thought she might be able to place him in some advantageous
position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>'Now that I have let you know I am all right,' the young
man resumed, 'I should like to go on to Arromanches.'</p>

<p>'No, no! it is getting late,' said Chanteau. 'We shall
be having some news of your mother presently. I am
expecting a message every moment. Listen! Isn't that a
carriage?'</p>

<p>Véronique had gone to open the door.</p>

<p>'It is Doctor Cazenove's gig,' she said. 'Shall I bring
him in, sir? Why! good gracious! there's madame in
it!'</p>

<p>They all three hurried down the steps. A huge dog, a
cross between a sheep-dog and a Newfoundland, who had been
lying asleep in a corner of the passage, sprang forward and
began to bark furiously. Upon hearing this barking, a small
white cat of delicate aspect made its way to the door, but, at the
sight of the wet and dirt outside, it gave a slight wriggle of
disgust with its tail, and sat down very sedately on the top
step to see what was going to happen.</p>

<p>A lady about fifty years of age sprang from the gig with
all the agility of a young girl. She was short and slight, her
hair was still perfectly black, and her face would have been
quite pleasant but for the largeness of her nose. The dog
sprang forward and placed his big paws on her shoulders, as
though he wanted to kiss her; but this displeased her.</p>

<p>'Down! down! Matthew. Get away, will you? Tiresome
animal!'</p>

<p>Lazare ran across the yard behind the dog, calling as he
went, 'All right, mother?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes!' replied Madame Chanteau.</p>

<p>'We have been very anxious about you,' said Chanteau,
who had followed his son, in spite of the wind. 'What has
happened to make you so late?'</p>

<p>'Oh! we've had nothing but troubles,' she answered. 'To
begin with, the roads are so bad that it has taken us nearly two
hours to come from Bayeux. Then, at Arromanches, one of
Malivoire's horses went lame and he couldn't let us have
another. At one time I really thought we should have to
stay with him all night. But the Doctor was kind enough to
offer us his gig, and Martin here has driven us home.'</p>

<p>The driver, an old man with a wooden leg, who had
formerly served in the navy, and had there had his limb
amputated by Cazenove, then a naval surgeon, had afterwards
taken service under the Doctor. He was tethering the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
horse when Madame Chanteau suddenly checked her flow of
speech and called to him:</p>

<p>'Martin! help the little girl to get down!'</p>

<p>No one had yet given a thought to the child. The hood
of the gig fell very low, and only her black skirt and little
black-gloved hands could be seen. She did not wait, however,
for the coachman's assistance, but sprang lightly to the
ground. Just then there came a fierce puff of wind, which
whirled her clothes about her and sent the curls of her
dark brown hair flying from under her crape-trimmed hat.
She did not seem very strong for her ten years. Her lips
were thick; and her face, if full, showed the pallor of the
girls who are brought up in the back shops of Paris. The
others stared at her. Véronique, who had just bustled up to
welcome her mistress, checked herself, her face assuming an
icy and jealous expression. But Matthew showed none of
this reserve. He sprang up between the child's arms and
licked her with his tongue.</p>

<p>'Don't be afraid of him!' cried Madame Chanteau. 'He
won't hurt you.'</p>

<p>'Oh! I'm not at all afraid of him,' said Pauline quietly;
'I am very fond of dogs.'</p>

<p>Indeed, Matthew's boisterous welcome did not seem to
disturb her in the slightest degree. Her grave little face broke
out into a smile beneath her black hat, and she affectionately
kissed the dog on his snout.</p>

<p>'Aren't you going to kiss your relations too?' exclaimed
Madame Chanteau. 'See, this is your uncle, since you call
me your aunt; and this is your cousin, a great strapping
scapegrace, who isn't half as well behaved as you are.'</p>

<p>The child manifested no awkward shyness. She kissed
everyone, and even found a word or two for each, with all the
grace of a young Parisienne already schooled in politeness.</p>

<p>'I am very much obliged to you, uncle, for taking me to
live with you&mdash;&mdash;You will see that we shall get on very well
together, cousin&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'What a sweet little thing she is!' cried Chanteau, quite
delighted.</p>

<p>Lazare looked at her in surprise, for he had pictured her
as being much smaller and far more shy and childish.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, she is a sweet child,' said the lady, 'and
you have no idea how brave she is! The wind blew straight
in our faces as we drove along, and the rain quite blinded us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Fully a score of times I thought that the hood, which was
flapping about like a veil, would be carried away altogether.
Well, that child there, instead of being alarmed, was quite
amused by it all and enjoyed it. But what are we stopping
out here for? It is no use getting any wetter than we are;
the rain is beginning to fall again.'</p>

<p>She turned round to see where Véronique was. When she
saw her keeping aloof and looking very surly, she said to her
sarcastically:</p>

<p>'Good evening, Véronique. How are you? While you
are making up your mind to come and speak to me, you had
better go and get a bottle of wine for Martin. We have not
been able to bring our luggage with us, but Malivoire will
bring it on early to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Then she suddenly checked herself and hastily returned
to the gig. 'My bag! my bag! Ah, there it is! I was
afraid it had slipped into the road.'</p>

<p>It was a large black leather bag, already whitened at the
corners by wear. She would not trust it to her son, but persisted
in carrying it herself. Just as they were at last about
to enter the house, another violent squall made them halt,
short of breath, near the door. The cat, sitting on the steps
with an air of curiosity, watched them fighting their way
onwards; and Madame Chanteau then inquired if Minouche
had behaved properly during her absence. The name of
Minouche again brought a smile to Pauline's serious little face.
She stooped down and fondled the cat, which rubbed itself
against her skirts, whilst holding its tail erect in the air.
Matthew for his part, in proclamation of the return, began
to bark again as he saw the family mounting the steps and
entering the vestibule.</p>

<p>'Ah, it is pleasant to be home again!' said Madame
Chanteau. 'I really thought that we should never get here.
Yes, Matthew, you are a very good dog, but please be quiet&mdash;Lazare,
do make him keep still. He is quite splitting my
ears!'</p>

<p>However, the dog proved obstinate, and the entry of the
Chanteaus into their dining-room was accompanied by this
lively music. They pushed Pauline, the new daughter of the
house, before them; Matthew came on behind, still barking
loudly; and Minouche followed last, with her sensitive hair
bristling amidst the uproar.</p>

<p>In the kitchen Martin had already drunk a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
glasses of wine, one after the other, and was now hastening
away, stamping over the floor with his wooden leg and calling
'good-night' to everybody. Véronique had just put the leg of
mutton to the fire again, as it had got quite cold. She thrust
her head into the room, and asked:</p>

<p>'Will you have dinner now?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed we will,' said Chanteau. 'It is seven o'clock.
But, my good girl, we must wait till madame and the little
one have changed their things.'</p>

<p>'But I haven't got Pauline's trunk here,' said Madame
Chanteau. 'Fortunately, however, our underclothing is not
wet. Take off your cloak and hat, my dear. There, take
them away, Véronique. And take off her boots. I have
some slippers here.'</p>

<p>The cook knelt down before the child, who had seated herself.
Madame Chanteau took out of her bag a pair of small
felt slippers and put them on the girl's feet. Then she took
off her own boots, and, once more dipping her hand into the
bag, brought out a pair of shoes for herself.</p>

<p>'Shall I bring dinner in now?' asked Véronique again.</p>

<p>'In a minute. Pauline, come into the kitchen and wash
your hands and face. We will make more of a toilet later
on, for, just now, we are dying of hunger.'</p>

<p>Pauline came back first, having left her aunt with her
nose in a bowl of water. Chanteau had resumed his place
in his big yellow velvet arm-chair before the fire. He was
rubbing his legs mechanically, fearing another attack of pain;
while Lazare stood cutting some bread in front of the table,
on which four covers had been laid more than an hour before.
The two men, who were scarcely at their ease, smiled at the
child, without managing to find a word to say to her; while
she calmly inspected the room, which was furnished in
walnut-wood. Her glance wandered from the sideboard and
the half-dozen chairs to the hanging lamp of polished brass,
and then rested upon some framed lithographs which hung
against the brown wall-paper. Four of them represented the
seasons, and the fifth was a view of Vesuvius. Probably
the imitation wainscotting of oak-coloured paint, scratched
and showing the plaster underneath, the flooring soiled with
old grease-spots, and the general shabbiness of this room,
where the family lived, made her regret the beautiful marble-fitted
shop which she had left the previous day, for her eyes
assumed an expression of sadness, and she seemed to guess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
all the cares that lay concealed in this her new dwelling-place.
Then, after curiously examining a very old barometer
mounted in a case of gilded wood, her eyes turned to a
strange-looking affair which monopolised the whole of the
mantelpiece. It was enclosed in a glass box, secured at the
edges by strips of blue paper. At first sight it looked like a
toy, a miniature wooden bridge; but a bridge of extremely
intricate design.</p>

<p>'That was made by your great-uncle,' explained Chanteau,
who was delighted to find a subject of conversation. 'My
father, you know, began life as a carpenter, and I have
always preserved his masterpiece.'</p>

<p>He was not at all ashamed of his origin, and Madame
Chanteau tolerated the presence of the bridge on the mantelpiece,
in spite of the displeasure which this cumbersome
curiosity always caused her by reminding her of her marriage
with a working-man's son. But the little girl was no longer
paying attention to her uncle's words, for through the window
she had just caught sight of the far-reaching horizon, and
she eagerly stepped forward and planted herself close to the
panes, whose muslin curtains were held back by cotton loops.
Since her departure from Paris her one continual thought
had been the sea. She had dreamed of it and never ceased
to question her aunt about it during their journey; inquiring
at every hill they came to whether the sea lay at the other side
of it. When at last they reached the beach at Arromanches,
she had been struck silent with wonder, her eyes dilating and
her heart heaving with a heavy sigh. From Arromanches to
Bonneville she had every minute thrust her head out of the
gig's hood, in spite of the violent wind, in order to look at the
sea, which seemed to follow them. And now the sea was still
there; it would always be there, as though it belonged to
her. With her eyes she seemed to be slowly taking possession
of it.</p>

<p>The night was falling from the grey sky, across which
the wind drove the clouds at headlong speed. Amid the increasing
darkness of that turbulent evening only the white
line of the rising tide could be distinguished. It was a band
of foam, which seemed to be ever widening, a succession of
waves flowing up, pouring over the tracts of weed and covering
the ridges of rock with a soft gliding motion, whose
approach seemed like a caress. But far away the roar of the
billows increased, huge crests arose, while at the foot of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
the cliff, where Bonneville had stowed itself away as securely
as possible behind its doors, there hovered a death-like gloom.
The boats, drawn up to the top of the shingle, lay there, alone
and deserted, like huge stranded fish. The rain steeped the
village in vaporous mist, and only the church still stood out
plainly against a pale patch of sky.</p>

<p>Pauline stood by the window in silence. Her little heart
was heaving anew. She seemed to be stifling, and as she drew
a deep sigh all her breath appeared to drain from her lips.</p>

<p>'Well! it's a good deal bigger than the Seine, isn't it?'
said Lazare, who had just taken his stand behind her.</p>

<p>The girl continued to be a source of much surprise to
him; he felt all the shy awkwardness of a schoolboy in her
presence.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' she replied, in a very low voice, without
turning her head.</p>

<p>'You are not frightened of it?'</p>

<p>At this she turned and looked at him with an expression
of astonishment. 'No, indeed. Why should I be? The
water won't come up so far as this!'</p>

<p>'Ah! one never knows what it will do,' he said, yielding to
an impulse to make fun of her. 'Sometimes the water rises
over the church.'</p>

<p>She broke into a hearty laugh, an outburst of noisy,
healthy gaiety, the merriment of a sensible person whom the
absurd delights.</p>

<p>'Ah! cousin,' said she, playfully taking the young man's
hand, 'I'm not so foolish as you think. You wouldn't stop
here if the sea were likely to come up over the church.'</p>

<p>Lazare laughed in his turn, and clasped the child's hands.
The pair were henceforth hearty friends. In the midst of
their merriment Madame Chanteau returned into the room.
She appeared quite delighted, and exclaimed as she rubbed
her hands: 'Ah! you have got to know each other, then?
I felt quite sure you would get on well together.'</p>

<p>'Shall I bring in dinner, Madame?' asked Véronique,
standing by the kitchen door.</p>

<p>'Yes, certainly, my girl. But you had better light the
lamp first; it is getting too dark to see.'</p>

<p>The night, indeed, was falling so quickly that the dining-room
would have been in darkness but for the red glow of the
coke fire. Lighting the lamp caused a further delay, but at
last the operation was satisfactorily performed, and the table<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
lay illuminated beneath the lowered shade. They were all
in their places, Pauline between her uncle and cousin, and
opposite her aunt, when the latter rose from her chair
again, with that restlessness of one who can never remain
still.</p>

<p>'Where is my bag? Wait a moment, my dear; I am
going to give you your mug. Take the glass away, Véronique.
The little girl is used to having her own mug.'</p>

<p>She took a silver mug, already a little battered, out of her
bag, and, having first wiped it with her napkin, placed it
before Pauline. Then she put the bag away behind her, on a
chair. The cook brought in some vermicelli soup, warning
them, in her crabbed fashion, that it was much overcooked.
No one dared complain, however. They were all very hungry,
and the soup hissed in their spoons. Next came some soup-beef.
Chanteau, fond of dainties, scarcely took any of it,
reserving himself for the leg of mutton. But when this was
placed upon the table there was a general outcry. It was
like fried leather; surely they could not eat it!</p>

<p>'I knew very well how it would be,' said Véronique,
placidly. 'You oughtn't to have kept it waiting.'</p>

<p>Pauline, with a laugh, cut her meat up into little bits, and
managed to swallow it, in spite of its toughness. As for
Lazare, he was quite unconscious of what he had upon his
plate, and would have eaten slices of dry bread without
knowing that they were not cut from a fowl's breast. Chanteau,
however, gazed at the leg of mutton with a mournful
expression.</p>

<p>'And what else have you got, Véronique?'</p>

<p>'Fried potatoes, sir.'</p>

<p>He made a gesture of despair and threw himself back in
his chair.</p>

<p>'Shall I bring the beef back again, sir?' asked the cook.</p>

<p>But he answered her with a melancholy shake of his head.
'As well have bread as boiled beef. Oh, my gracious! what
a dinner! and just in this bad weather, too, when we can't
get any fish.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau, who was a very small eater, looked at
him compassionately.</p>

<p>'My poor dear,' she said, suddenly, 'you quite distress
me. I have brought a little present with me; I meant
it for to-morrow, but as there seems to be a famine this
evening&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>She had opened her bag as she spoke and drew out of it a
pan of <i>foie gras</i>. Chanteau's eyes flashed brightly. <i>Foie gras!</i>
Ah, it was forbidden fruit! A luxury which he adored, but
which his doctor had absolutely forbidden him to touch.</p>

<p>'You know,' continued his wife, 'you must have only
a very little. Don't be foolish, now, or you shall never have
any more.'</p>

<p>Chanteau had caught hold of the pan, and he began to
open it with trembling hands. There were frequently tremendous
struggles between his greediness and his fear of gout; and
almost invariably it was his greediness that got the upper
hand. Never mind! it was too good to resist, and he would
put up with the pain that would follow.</p>

<p>Véronique, who had watched him helping himself to a
thick slice, took herself off to the kitchen, grumbling as she
went:</p>

<p>'Well, well! how he will bellow to-morrow!'</p>

<p>The word 'bellow' was habitually on her tongue, and her
master and mistress had grown quite used and reconciled to it,
so naturally and simply did it come from her lips. When
the master had an attack of gout he bellowed, according to
Véronique, and she was never scolded for her want of respect
in saying so. The dinner ended very merrily. Lazare
jokingly dispossessed his father of the <i>foie gras</i>. When the
cheese and biscuits were put upon the table, Matthew's
sudden appearance caused a boisterous commotion. Until
then he had been lying asleep under the table. But the
arrival of the biscuits had awakened him. He seemed to
have scented them in his sleep. Every evening, just at this
stage of the meal, it was his custom to get up and shake himself
and make the round of the table, questioning the faces of
the diners to see if they were charitably disposed. Usually it
was Lazare who first took pity upon him, but that evening
Matthew, on his second circuit of the table, halted by
Pauline's side and gazed up at her earnestly with his honest
human-like eyes; and then, divining in her a friend both of
man and beast, he laid his huge head on her little knee, without
dropping his glance of mild supplication.</p>

<p>'Oh, what a shameful beggar you are!' said Madame
Chanteau. 'Aren't you ashamed of yourself, Matthew, to be
so greedy?'</p>

<p>The dog swallowed at a single gulp the piece of biscuit
which Pauline offered him, and then again laid his head on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
her little knee, asking for another piece, with his eyes constantly
fixed on those of his new friend. She laughed at
him and kissed him and found him very amusing, with his
flattened ears and the black spot under his left eye, the only
spot of colour that marked his rough white hairy coat. Then
there came a diversion of another character. Minouche,
growing jealous, leapt lightly upon the edge of the table, and
began to purr and rub her head against the little girl's chin,
swaying her supple body the while with all the grace of a
young kid. To poke one with her cold nose and kiss one
lightly with her sharp teeth, while she pounded about with
her feet like a baker kneading dough, was her feline way of
caressing. Pauline was now quite delighted between the
two animals. The cat on her left, the dog on her right, took
possession of her and worried her shamefully in order to
secure all her biscuits.</p>

<p>'Send them away,' said her aunt. 'They will leave you
nothing for yourself.'</p>

<p>'Oh! that doesn't matter,' she placidly replied, feeling
quite happy in being despoiled.</p>

<p>They finished, and Véronique removed the dishes. The
two animals, seeing the table quite bare, gave their lips a last
lick and then took themselves off, without even saying 'thank
you.'</p>

<p>Pauline rose from her chair, and went to stand by the
window, straining her eyes to penetrate the darkness. Ever
since the soup had been put upon the table she had been
watching the window grow darker and darker, till it had
gradually become as black as ink. Now it was like an
impenetrable wall; the dense darkness had hidden everything&mdash;sky,
sea, village, and even church itself. Nevertheless,
without feeling in the least disturbed by her cousin's jests,
she tried to distinguish the water, worrying to find out how
far the tide was going to rise; but she could only hear its
ever-increasing roar, its angry threatening voice, which
seemed to grow louder every minute amidst the howling of
the wind and the splashing of the rain. Not a glimmer, not
even the whiteness of the foam, could be seen in that chaos;
and nothing was heard but the rush of the waves, lashed on
by the gale in the black depths.</p>

<p>'Dear me,' said Chanteau, 'it is coming up stiffly, and yet
it won't be high-water for another couple of hours.'</p>

<p>'If the wind were to blow from the north,' put in Lazare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
'Bonneville would certainly be swept away. Fortunately
for us here, it is coming slantwise.'</p>

<p>The little maid had turned and was listening to them, her
big eyes full of an expression of anxious pity.</p>

<p>'Bah!' said Madame Chanteau, 'we are safe under shelter,
and we must let other folks get out of their trouble as best
they may&mdash;&mdash;Tell me, my dear, would you like a cup of hot
tea? And then, afterwards, we will go to bed.'</p>

<p>Véronique had laid an old red cloth, with a faded pattern
of big bunches of flowers, over the dinner-table, around
which the family generally spent the evening. They took
their accustomed places. Lazare, who had left the room for
a moment, came back carrying an inkstand, a pen, and a
whole handful of papers, and, seating himself beneath the
lamp-light, he began to copy some music. Madame Chanteau,
whose eyes since her return had never ceased following her
son with an affectionate glance, suddenly became very stiff
and surly.</p>

<p>'That music of yours again! You can't devote an
evening to us, then, even on the night of my return home?'</p>

<p>'But, mother, I am not going out of the room. I mean
to stay with you. You know very well that this doesn't
interfere with my talking. Fire away and talk to me, and I
will answer you.'</p>

<p>He went on with his work, covering half the table with
his papers. Chanteau had stretched himself out comfortably
in his arm-chair, with his hands hanging listlessly at
his sides. In front of the fire Matthew lay asleep, while
Minouche, who had sprung upon the table again, was performing
an elaborate toilet, carefully licking her stomach,
with one leg cocked up in the air. The falling light from the
hanging lamp seemed to make everything cosy and homelike,
and Pauline, who with half-closed eyelids had been smiling
upon her newly-found relatives, could no longer keep herself
from sleep, worn out as she was with fatigue and rendered
drowsy by the heat of the room. Her head slipped down
upon her arm, which was resting on the table, and lay there,
motionless, beneath the placid glow of the lamp. Her delicate
eyelids looked like a silk veil cast over her eyes, and soft
regular breath came gently from her pure lips.</p>

<p>'She must be tired out,' said Madame Chanteau, lowering
her voice. 'We will just wake her up to give her some tea,
and then I will take her to bed.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Then silence reigned in the room. No sound broke upon
the howling of the storm except the scratching of Lazare's
pen. It was perfect quiet, the habitual sleepiness of life
spent every evening in the same spot. For a long time the
father and mother looked at each other without saying a
word. At last Chanteau asked, in a hesitating voice:</p>

<p>'And is Davoine doing well at Caen?'</p>

<p>'Bah! Doing well, indeed! I told you that you were
being taken in!'</p>

<p>Now that the child was fast asleep they could talk. They
spoke in low tones, however, and at first seemed inclined to
tell each other what there was to be told as briefly as possible.
But presently passion got the better of them and carried
them on, and, by degrees, all the worries of the household
became manifest.</p>

<p>At the death of his father the former journeyman carpenter,
who had carried on his timber-trade with ambitious
audacity, Chanteau had found the business considerably
compromised. A very inactive man himself, unaspiring and
careful, he had contented himself with simply putting matters
on a safe basis, by dint of good management, and living upon
a moderate but sure profit. The one romance of his life was
his marriage. He had married a governess whom he had
met in a friend's family. Eugénie de la Vignière, the orphan
daughter of one of the ruined squireens of the Cotentin,
reckoned upon fanning his indolent nature into ambition.
But he with his imperfect education, for he had been sent
late to school, recoiled from vast schemes, and opposed his
own natural inertness to the ambitious plans of his wife.
When their son was born, she transferred to that child her
hopes for the family's rise in life, sent him to college, and
superintended his studies every evening herself. But a last
disaster upset all her plans. Chanteau, who had suffered
from gout from the time he was forty years of age, at
last experienced such severe and painful attacks that he
began to talk about selling his business. To Madame Chanteau
this portended straitened means and mediocrity, the
spending of their remaining days in retirement on their petty
savings, and the casting of her son into the struggle for life,
without the support of an income of twenty thousand francs,
such as she had dreamed of for him.</p>

<p>Thereupon she had insisted upon having, at any rate, a
hand in the sale. The profits were about ten thousand francs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
a year, on which the family made a considerable show, for
Madame Chanteau was fond of giving parties. Having discovered
a certain Davoine, she had worked out the following
scheme. Davoine was to buy the timber business for a
hundred thousand francs, but he was only to pay fifty
thousand in money; in consideration of the other fifty
thousand remaining unpaid, the Chanteaus were to become
his partners in the business and share the profits. This man
Davoine appeared to be a very bold fellow, and, even if he
did not extend the business of the firm, they would still be
sure of five thousand francs a year, which, added to the
interest of the fifty thousand invested in stock, would give
them altogether an income of eight thousand francs.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And
on this they would get on as well as they could, pending the
time when their son should achieve some brilliant success and
be able to extricate them from a life of mediocrity.</p>

<p>It was upon these principles that the business was sold.
Two years previously Chanteau had bought a seaside house
at Bonneville, which he had been able to get as a bargain
through the bankruptcy of an insolvent debtor. Instead of
selling it again at a profit, as for a time she had thought of
doing, Madame Chanteau determined that the family should
go and live there, at any rate until Lazare had achieved his
first successes. To give up her parties and bury herself in such
an out-of-the-way place was for her, indeed, almost suicide;
but as she had agreed to surrender their entire house to
Davoine, she would have had to rent another, and so she summoned
up all her resolution to go in for a life of economy,
with the firm hope of one day making a triumphal return to
Caen, when her son should have gained a high position.
Chanteau gave his consent to everything. His gout would
have to accommodate itself to the sea air, and, besides, of
three doctors whom he had consulted, two had been good
enough to declare that the fresh breezes from the open would
act as a splendid tonic on his system generally. So, one
morning in May, the Chanteaus departed to settle at Bonneville,
leaving Lazare, then fourteen years old, at the college
at Caen.</p>

<p>Since this heroic exile, five years had passed, and the
affairs of the family had gone from bad to worse. As Davoine
was constantly launching out into fresh speculations, he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
ever telling them that it was necessary he should have
further advances; and the consequence was that all the
profits were risked again and again, and the balance-sheet
generally showed a loss. The Chanteaus were reduced to
living at Bonneville on the three thousand francs a year
derived from the money they had invested in stock, and they
were so hardly pressed that they had been obliged to sell their
horse, and get Véronique to undertake the management of
the kitchen garden.</p>

<p>'At any rate, Eugénie,' said Chanteau, a little timorously,
'if I have been let in, it is partly your fault.'</p>

<p>But she repudiated the responsibility altogether. She
always conveniently forgot that the partnership with Davoine
was her own work.</p>

<p>'My fault indeed!' she replied drily. 'How can that be?
Am I laid up? If you were not such an invalid, we might
perhaps be millionaires.'</p>

<p>Whenever his wife attacked him in this bitter fashion, he
always lowered his head with pain and shame at the thought
that it was his illness that was ruining the family.</p>

<p>'We must wait and be patient,' he murmured. 'Davoine
appears to be very confident of the success of his new
scheme. If the price of deal goes up, we shall make a
fortune.'</p>

<p>'And what good will that be?' interrupted Lazare, who
was still copying out his music. 'We have enough to eat as
it is. It is very foolish of you worrying yourselves in this
way. I don't care a bit about money.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau shrugged her shoulders again.</p>

<p>'It would be a great deal better if you cared about it a
little more, and didn't waste your time in foolish nonsense.'</p>

<p>It was she herself who had taught him to play the piano,
though the mere sight of a score now sufficed to make her
angry. Her last hope had fled. This son of hers, whom she
had dreamed of seeing a prefect or a judge, talked of writing
operas; and she foresaw that in the future he would be
reduced to running about the streets giving lessons, as she
herself had once done.</p>

<p>'Here is the balance-sheet for the last three months, which
Davoine gave me,' she said. 'If things continue in this way,
it will be we who shall owe him money by next July.'</p>

<p>She had put her bag upon the table, and she took out of it
a paper, which she handed to Chanteau. He just turned it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
round, and then laid it down in front of him without opening
it. At that moment Véronique brought in the tea. No one
spoke for some time, and the cups remained empty. Minouche
was dozing placidly beside the sugar-basin, and Matthew was
snoring like a man before the fire. The roar of the sea continued
outside like a mighty bass accompaniment to the
peaceful echoes of the drowsy room.</p>

<p>'Won't you awaken her, mother?' said Lazare, at last.
'It can't be good for her to go on sleeping there.'</p>

<p>'Yes! yes!' murmured Madame Chanteau, who seemed
buried in deep thought, with her eyes fixed upon Pauline.</p>

<p>They all three looked at the sleeping girl. Her breathing
was very calm, and there was a flowery softness about her
pale cheeks and rosy lips beneath the glow of the lamp-light.
Her chestnut curls, which the wind had disarranged, cast
a slight shadow over her delicate brow. Then Madame
Chanteau's thoughts reverted to her visit to Paris, and all
the bother she had met with there, and she felt quite astonished
at the enthusiasm with which she had undertaken the
child's guardianship, inspired with instinctive regard for a
wealthy ward, though her intentions of course were scrupulously
honourable, and quite without thought of benefiting by
the fortune of which she would be trustee.</p>

<p>'When I alighted at the shop,' she began slowly, 'she
was wearing a little black frock, and she came to kiss me,
sobbing and crying. It is a very fine shop indeed; beautifully
fitted up with marble and plate-glass, and just in front of the
markets. There was such a servant there, about as big as
a jackboot, with a fresh red face. It was she who had given
information to the notary, and had brought him to put everything
under seal. When I got there she was going on quietly
selling sausages and black puddings. It was Adèle who told
me about our poor cousin Quenu's death. Ever since he had
lost his wife, six months previously, his blood seemed to be
suffocating him. He was constantly fidgeting about his neck
with his hand to loosen his neckerchief; and at last they found
him one evening lying with his face all purple in a bowl of
dripping. His uncle Gradelle died in just the same way.'</p>

<p>She said no more, and silence fell again. Over Pauline's
face, as she lay asleep, there played a passing smile, suggesting
some pleasant dream.</p>

<p>'And the law business, was that all transacted satisfactorily?'
asked Chanteau.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh! quite so. But your lawyer was very right in leaving
a blank for the name in the power-of-attorney; for it appears
that I could not have acted in your stead, as women are not
eligible in such matters. But, as I wrote and told you, on my
arrival I went to consult the parish lawyer who sent us the
extract from the will in which you were appointed guardian.
He at once inserted his chief clerk's name in the power-of-attorney,
which is quite a common course, he tells me. Then
we were able to get along. I went before a justice of the
peace and nominated as members of the family council three
relations on Lisa's side: two young cousins, Octave Mouret
and Claude Lantier, and a cousin by marriage, Monsieur
Rambaud, who lives at Marseilles; then, on our side, that is
Quenu's side, I chose his nephews, Naudet, Liardin, and
Delorme. It is a very proper council, you see, and one which
we can easily manage as we think best for the child's benefit.
At their first meeting they nominated as surrogate-guardian
Monsieur Saccard,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> whom I had chosen, out of necessity, from
among Lisa's relations.'</p>

<p>'Hush! hush! She is waking up,' interrupted Lazare.</p>

<p>Pauline had just opened her eyes widely. Without
moving, she gazed with some astonishment at the people
talking around her, and then, with a smile full of sleepiness,
closed her eyes once more, being worn out with fatigue.
Again did her motionless little face show a milky camellia-like
transparency.</p>

<p>'Isn't that Saccard the speculator?' asked Chanteau.</p>

<p>'Yes,' answered his wife. 'I saw him, and we had a talk
together. He is a charming man. He has so many things to
look after, he told me, that I must not reckon much on his
assistance. But, you know, we really don't want anybody's
help. From the moment we take the child&mdash;well, we do take
her; and we don't want anybody coming and interfering with
us. All the other business was got through quickly. Your
power-of-attorney conferred all the necessary authority. The
seals were removed, an inventory of the property was made,
and the business was sold by auction. The sale went off
splendidly, for there were two parties bidding hotly one
against the other, and so we got ninety thousand francs,
cash down. The notary had previously discovered scrip for sixty
thousand francs in a desk. I begged him to buy more scrip,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
and so now we have a hundred and fifty thousand francs
securely invested. I have brought the scrip along with me,
having first given the chief clerk the full discharge and
receipt, which I asked you to send me by return of post. See!
here it is!'</p>

<p>She had thrust her hand into her bag and brought out a
bulky packet. It was the scrip, tied up between two pieces
of thick cardboard which had formed the binding of one of
the shop account-books. The green marbled surface was
speckled with grease-spots. Both father and son looked
attentively at the fortune which lay upon the shabby tablecloth.</p>

<p>'The tea is getting cold, mother,' said Lazare, putting
his pen down at last. 'Hadn't I better pour it out?'</p>

<p>He got up from his seat and filled the cups. His mother
had returned no answer to his question. Her eyes were still
fixed on the scrip.</p>

<p>'Of course,' she continued slowly, 'at a subsequent
meeting of the family council which I summoned, I asked to
have my travelling expenses reimbursed, and the sum that
we are to receive for the child's maintenance was fixed at
eight hundred francs a year. We are not so rich as she is,
and we cannot afford to take her for nothing. None of us
would desire to make a farthing profit out of the girl, but it
would have pressed us too much to have kept her out of our
own income. The interest of her fortune will be banked and
invested, and her capital will be almost doubled by the time
she comes of age. Well, it is only our duty that we are doing.
We are bound to obey the wishes of the dead. And if it costs
us something to do it, perhaps the sacrifice may bring us
better fortune, of which, I am sure, we stand in great need&mdash;&mdash;The
poor little dear was so cut up, and sobbed so bitterly at
leaving her nurse! I trust she will be happy with us here.'</p>

<p>The two men were quite affected.</p>

<p>'Most certainly I shall never be unkind to her,' said
Chanteau.</p>

<p>'She is a charming little thing,' added Lazare. 'I love
her already.'</p>

<p>Just then Matthew appeared to have smelt the tea in his
dreams, for he gave himself a shake, and again came and
thrust his big head upon the edge of the table. Minouche,
too, got up and stretched herself and yawned, and, when she
was quite awake, she craned out her neck to sniff at the
packet of papers in the greasy covers. As the Chanteaus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
glanced at Pauline, they saw that her eyes were also open
and fixed upon the scrip and the old ledger binding.</p>

<p>'Ah! she knows very well what is inside there,' said
Madame Chanteau. 'Don't you, my dear? I showed them
all to you in Paris. That is what your poor father and
mother have left you.'</p>

<p>Tears trickled down the child's face. Her grief often
recurred in April-like showers. But she soon smiled again
through her tears, feeling amused at Minouche, who had for
a long time smelt at the papers and was doubtless attracted
by their odour, for she began to purr and rub her head
against the corners of the ledger.</p>

<p>'Come away, Minouche!' cried Madame Chanteau.
'Money isn't to be made a plaything of!'</p>

<p>Chanteau laughed, and so did Lazare. With his head
resting on the edge of the table, Matthew was becoming quite
excited. Looking eagerly with his flaming eyes at the
packet of papers which he must have taken for some great
delicacy, he began to bark at the cat. Then all the family
grew lively. Pauline caught up Minouche and fondled her
in her arms as though she were a doll.</p>

<p>For fear the girl should drop off to sleep again, Madame
Chanteau made her drink her tea at once. Then she called
Véronique.</p>

<p>'Bring us our candles. Here we are sitting and talking
and never going to bed. Why! it is actually ten o'clock, and
I am so tired that I half fell asleep at dinner!'</p>

<p>But a man's voice sounded from the kitchen, and when
the cook returned with four lighted candles her mistress
asked her:</p>

<p>'Whom were you talking to?'</p>

<p>'It is Prouane, Madame. He came up to tell the master
that things are in a very bad way down yonder. The sea is
breaking everything to pieces apparently.'</p>

<p>Chanteau had been prevailed upon to accept office as
mayor of Bonneville, and Prouane, the tipsy scamp, who
acted as Abbé Horteur's beadle, likewise discharged the
duties of mayor's clerk. He had been a non-commissioned
officer in the navy, and wrote a copybook hand. When they
called to him to come into the room, he made his appearance
with his woollen cap in his hand and his jacket and boots
streaming with water.</p>

<p>'Well! what's the matter, Prouane?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>'Sure, sir, the Cuches' house is completely flooded. And
if it goes on like this much longer it will be the same with
the Gonins'. We have all been down there, Tourmal, Houtelard,
myself, and the others. But it is no use; we can't do
anything against that thievish sea. It's written that it will
carry off a slice of the land every year.'</p>

<p>Then they all became silent. The four candles burned
with tall flames, and the rush of the devouring sea against
the cliffs broke through the night air. It was now high tide,
and the house shook as every wave dashed against the rocky
barrier. It was like the roaring of giant artillery; thunderous
consecutive reports arose amidst the rolling of shingle, which,
as it swept over the rocks, sounded like the continuous crackling
of a fusillade. And amidst all this uproar the wind
raised its howling plaint, and the rain, every now and then
increasing in violence, seemed to pelt the walls of the house
with a hail of bullets.</p>

<p>'It is like the end of the world,' Madame Chanteau
murmured. 'What will the Cuches do? Where are they
going to take refuge?'</p>

<p>'They will have to be sheltered,' said Prouane. 'Meantime
they are at the Gonins'. What a sight it was!
There was a little lad, who is only three years old, perfectly
drenched, and his mother with nothing on but a petticoat&mdash;begging
your pardon for mentioning it&mdash;and the father,
too, with his hand split open by a falling beam, while madly
trying to save their few rags.'</p>

<p>Pauline had risen from the table and returned to the
window. She listened to what was being said with all the
serious demeanour of a grown-up person. Her expression
indicated distressful sympathy and pity, and her full lips
trembled with emotion.</p>

<p>'Oh, aunt!' she said, 'how very sad for the poor things!'
Then her gaze wandered through the window into that inky
darkness where nothing was visible. They could hear that
the sea had reached the road, and was sweeping wildly and
fiercely over it, but they could see nothing. The little village
and the rocks and the whole neighbourhood seemed submerged
beneath a flood of ink. For the young girl it was a painful
experience and surprise. That sea which she had thought so
beautiful hurled itself upon poor folks and ruined them!</p>

<p>'I will go down with you, Prouane,' cried Lazare.
'Perhaps something can be done.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>'Oh yes! do go, cousin!' said Pauline, with flashing
eyes. But the man shook his head.</p>

<p>'It is no use troubling yourself, Monsieur Lazare; you
couldn't do anything more than the others. We can only
stand about and watch the sea work its will, and destroy
what it likes, and when it gets tired of that we shall have to
be grateful that it has done no worse. I merely came up to
inform Monsieur Chanteau.'</p>

<p>Then Chanteau began to grow angry, bothered by this
business, which would give him an uneasy night and demand
all his attention in the morning.</p>

<p>'I don't believe there ever was a village built in such an
idiotic position!' he cried. 'You have buried yourselves
right under the waves, and it's no wonder if the sea swallows
up your houses one by one. And why ever in the world do
you stop in such a place? You should leave it and go
elsewhere.'</p>

<p>'Where can we go?' asked Prouane, who listened with
an expression of stupefaction. 'We are here, sir, and we
have got to stop here. We must be somewhere.'</p>

<p>'Yes, that's true,' said Madame Chanteau, bringing the
discussion to an end. 'And wherever you are, here or elsewhere,
there will always be trouble&mdash;&mdash;We are just going
to bed. Good-night. To-morrow it will be light.'</p>

<p>The man went off bowing, and they heard Véronique bolt
the door behind him. They took their candles and gave a
parting caress to Matthew and Minouche, who both slept
in the kitchen. Lazare collected his music together, and
Madame Chanteau put the scrip in its greasy covers beneath
her arm, and also took from the table Davoine's balance-sheet,
which her husband had forgotten. It was a heart-breaking
paper, and the sooner it was put out of sight the
better.</p>

<p>'We are going to bed, Véronique,' she cried. 'You need
not wander up and down at this time of night.' But, hearing
nothing save a grunt in the kitchen, she added in lower
tones:</p>

<p>'What is the matter with her? I haven't brought a
baby home for her to wean!'</p>

<p>'Leave her alone,' said Chanteau. 'She has her whims,
you know. Well! we are all four here: so good-night!'</p>

<p>He himself slept on the ground floor, in a room on the
other side of the passage. This arrangement had been made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
so that, when he was suffering from an attack of gout, he
might be readily wheeled in his arm-chair either to table or
to the terrace. He opened the door, and then stood still
for a moment. His legs were very heavy, as at the approach
of a fresh attack, of which, indeed, the stiffness of his joints
had been giving him warning since the previous day. Plainly
enough, he had acted very foolishly in eating that <i>foie gras</i>.
The consciousness of his error made him feel anything but
happy.</p>

<p>'Good-night,' he repeated in a mournful voice. 'You
others can always sleep. Good-night, my little dear. Have
a good long rest; you want it at your age.'</p>

<p>'Good-night, uncle,' said Pauline in reply, as she kissed
him. Then the door closed. Madame Chanteau went upstairs
first with the little girl. Lazare followed behind.</p>

<p>'Well, for my part, I shan't want anyone to rock me to
sleep to-night,' said the old lady, 'that's quite certain. And
I don't at all object to that uproar. I find it lulling. When
I was in Paris I quite missed the shaking of my bed.'</p>

<p>They all went up to the first floor. Pauline, who carefully
held her candlestick straight, was somewhat amused by
this procession in Indian file, each carrying a lighted candle,
which set all their shadows dancing. When she reached the
landing she paused, hesitating where to go, till her aunt
gently pushed her forward.</p>

<p>'Straight on,' she said. 'That room there is kept for
visitors, and this one opposite is mine. Come in for a
minute; I want to show you something.'</p>

<p>The bedroom, hung with yellow cretonne with a pattern
of green leaves, was very plainly furnished in mahogany.
There was a bed, a wardrobe, and a secrétaire. In the
middle stood a small table on a square of red carpet. When
she had examined every corner carefully with her candle,
Madame Chanteau went up to the secrétaire and opened it.</p>

<p>'Come and look!' she said.</p>

<p>She drew out one of the little drawers and placed
Davoine's disastrous balance-sheet in it, with a sigh. Then
she emptied the drawer above it, pulled it right out and shook
it, to clear it of a few old scraps, and, with Pauline looking at
her as she prepared to stow the scrip away in it, she said:</p>

<p>'I am going to put it in here, you see. There is nothing
else in the drawer, and it will be all by itself. Would you
like to put it there yourself?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>Pauline felt a slight sense of shame, which she could not
have accounted for. She blushed as she answered, 'Oh!
aunt dear, what difference does it make?'</p>

<p>But she had already taken the old ledger-binding in her
hand, and she put it in the drawer, while Lazare threw the
light of the candle he was holding upon the secrétaire.</p>

<p>'There!' said Madame Chanteau, 'you are quite sure
about it now, and you may feel quite easy about it. The
drawer is the top one on the left, remember. It will stop
there till the day when you are old enough to come and take
it out and do what you like with it. Minouche won't be
able to come and eat it here, will she?'</p>

<p>The idea of Minouche opening the secrétaire and eating
the papers quite tickled the child's fancy, and she broke into
a merry laugh. Her momentary embarrassment altogether
disappeared, and she began to joke with Lazare, who amused
her by purring like a cat and pretending to make an attack
upon the secrétaire. He, too, laughed gaily. His mother,
however, very solemnly locked the flap, turning the key
round twice.</p>

<p>'It is quite safe now,' she said. 'Come, Lazare, don't
make yourself ridiculous. Now, Pauline, I will go up with
you to your room to see if you have got everything you want.'</p>

<p>They all three filed out into the staircase. When they
reached the second floor, Pauline with some hesitation opened
the door of the room on her left, but her aunt immediately
called out:</p>

<p>'No! no! not that one! That's your cousin's room.
Yours is the one opposite.'</p>

<p>Pauline, however, stood where she was, lost in amazement
at the size of the room and the state of confusion it was in.
It contained a piano, a couch, and a huge table, besides a lot
of books and pictures. And when at last she opened the
opposite door, she was quite delighted to find that her own
room was a very small one in comparison with the other.
The wall-paper was of a creamy yellow, flowered with blue
roses. The furniture consisted of an iron bedstead hung with
muslin curtains, a dressing-table, a chest of drawers, and
three chairs.</p>

<p>'Yes; you have everything here, I think,' said Madame
Chanteau&mdash;'water, sugar, towels, and soap. I hope you will
sleep well. Véronique has a little room beside you. If you
feel at all frightened, knock on the wall.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>'And I am close to you as well,' added Lazare. 'If a
ghost comes, I will fly at him with my sword.'</p>

<p>The doors of both rooms, which faced each other, were
open; Pauline's eyes strayed from one to the other.</p>

<p>'There are no ghosts,' she said merrily. 'You must keep
your sword for robbers. Good-night, aunt. Good-night,
cousin.'</p>

<p>'Good-night, my dear. You know how to undress yourself?'</p>

<p>'Oh! yes. I am getting a big girl, you know, now. I
always did everything for myself in Paris.'</p>

<p>They kissed her, and Madame Chanteau told her, as she
went off, that she might lock her door. But the child had
already sprung to the window, impatient to find out whether
it overlooked the sea. The rain was streaming so violently
down the panes that she dared not open it. All was pitchy
dark outside, but she felt quite happy when she heard the
waves beating beneath her. Then, in spite of her fatigue,
which almost prevented her from keeping her eyes open,
she walked round the room and examined the furniture. The
thought that she was to have a room of her own, separate
from anyone else, where she might shut herself up entirely
alone, quite flattered and pleased her, and made her feel as
though she were grown up already. Just as she was about
to turn the key in the lock, however, she hesitated, and felt
a little uneasy. How should she escape, if she should see
anybody in the night? She trembled for a moment, and
then, though she was in her petticoats, having taken off
her dress, she opened the door. Opposite to her she saw
Lazare, standing in the middle of his room and looking at
her.</p>

<p>'Well?' he said. 'What's the matter? Do you want
anything?'</p>

<p>She turned very red, and felt disposed to tell him a fib,
but her natural frankness got the better of that inclination.</p>

<p>'No, nothing,' she replied. 'But I feel afraid, do you
know, when the door is locked; so I am not going to fasten
it; and if you hear me knock, it will be for you to come. You,
mind, and not the cook!'</p>

<p>He had walked out of his room to her door, attracted by the
charm of her child-like frankness and innocence.</p>

<p>'Good-night!' he repeated, stretching out his arms to
her. She thereupon threw her puny little arms round his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
neck and pressed him to her, quite regardless of the scantiness
of her attire.</p>

<p>'Good-night, cousin!'</p>

<p>Five minutes later she bravely blew her candle out, and
buried herself in her muslin-curtained bed. For a long time
her slumber was light and broken, from her very weariness.
She heard Véronique come upstairs, without the least care
to hush her footsteps, and then push her furniture about
with noise enough to waken everybody. After a while, however,
there was nothing to be heard save the tumult of the
storm outside. The rain beat down upon the slates; the
wind shook the windows and whistled under the doors, and
the girl long listened to that cannonading, and trembled
and quivered as each wave broke against the cliff. It seemed
to her that the house, now silent and lifeless, was being
carried out to sea like a ship. Then, as she grew warm and
snug beneath her blankets, her wandering thoughts strayed,
with sympathetic pity, to the poor people down in the
village, whom the sea was driving from their beds. But at
last everything faded from her mind, and she slept soundly,
scarce breathing.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="II" id="II">II</a></h3>


<p>From the first week Pauline's presence in the house proved
a source of joy and pleasure to the family. Her cheerful
healthiness and her calm, tranquil smile spread a softening
influence over the asperities of the Chanteau household. In
her the father found a nurse, while the mother was made
happy by the fact that her son now spent more of his time at
home. It was only Véronique who went on grumbling and
growling. The knowledge that there were a hundred and
fifty thousand francs locked up in the secrétaire, although
they were to remain scrupulously untouched, seemed also to
give the family a semblance of wealth. There was a new
influence in their midst, and fresh hopes arose, though what
they were it would have been difficult to say.</p>

<p>On the third night after Pauline's arrival, the attack of
gout, which Chanteau had foreseen, broke out in all its violence.
For a week past he had been experiencing prickings
in his joints, tremblings and quiverings in his legs, and an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
utter distaste for all exercise. He had gone to bed feeling
somewhat easier, but about three o'clock in the morning had
been seized with a frightful pain in the big toe of his left foot.
Thence it had quickly spread to his heel, and then risen to his
ankle. He endured the agony as well as he could till morning,
sweating beneath his blankets, anxious as he was to disturb
nobody. His attacks were the dread of the whole house,
and he always put off calling for assistance till the last possible
minute, feeling ashamed of his helplessness, and dreading
the angry reception which awaited the announcement of
each fresh attack. But when he heard Véronique go past his
door, about eight o'clock in the morning, he could no longer
restrain a groan, as a sharper spasm of pain than previously
shot through his foot.</p>

<p>'There we are again!' growled the cook. 'Just listen to
him bellowing!'</p>

<p>She came into the room and watched him as he lay moaning
and tossing his head about. And her only attempt at
consolation was to say: 'You don't suppose this will please
Madame when she hears of it, do you?'</p>

<p>As soon as Madame Chanteau heard of her husband's
fresh attack she bounced into the room, and, letting her
hands drop by her sides in angry desperation, cried out:
'What, again! No sooner do I get back than this begins
afresh!'</p>

<p>For the last fifteen years she had harboured intense hatred
against gout. She cursed it as an enemy, a thief that had
blighted her existence, ruined her son, blasted all her hopes.
If it had not been for that gout, would they have all been
living a life of exile in that forsaken hole? Thus, in
spite of all her natural kindness, she always manifested a
petulant, hostile disposition towards her husband in his
attacks, declaring, too, that she was quite incapable of nursing
him.</p>

<p>'Oh! what agony I suffer!' groaned the unhappy man.
'I know it is going to be much worse this time than it was
the last. Don't stop there, as it puts you out so, but send for
Doctor Cazenove at once.'</p>

<p>The house was immediately in a state of commotion.
Lazare set off to Arromanches, though the family retained but
little confidence in medical help. During the last fifteen
years Chanteau had tried all sorts of medicines, and with each
fresh kind he had only grown worse. His attacks, which at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
first had been slight and infrequent, had quickly multiplied
and become much more violent. He was racked with
pain in both feet, and one of his knees was threatened also.
Three times already had he seen his system of treatment
changed, and his wretched body had become a mere basis for
experimenting with competing nostrums. After being copiously
bled, he had been scoured with purgatives, and now they
crammed him with colchicum and lithium. The draining-away
of his blood and the weakening of his frame had
turned what had been intermittent into chronic gout.
Local treatment had been no more successful. Leeches had
left his joints in a state of painful stiffness; opium only prolonged
his attacks, and blisters brought on ulceration.
Wiesbaden and Carlsbad had done him no good, and a season
at Vichy had all but killed him.</p>

<p>'Oh dear! oh dear! what agony I am suffering!' repeated
poor Chanteau. 'It is just as though a lot of dogs were
gnawing at my feet.'</p>

<p>He was perpetually altering the position of his leg, hoping
to gain some relief by the change, but he was still racked with
agony, and each fresh movement drew another groan from him.
Presently, as the paroxysms of his pain grew sharper, a
continuous howl came from his lips. He shivered and grew
quite feverish, and his throat was parched with a burning
thirst.</p>

<p>Pauline had just glided into his room. She stood by his
bed and gazed at him gravely, but did not give way to tears;
though Madame Chanteau lost her head, distracted by her
husband's cries and groans. Véronique wished to arrange the
bed-clothes differently, as the sufferer found their weight
intolerable, but as she was about to lay hold of them with her
big awkward hands he screamed yet more loudly and forbade
her to touch him. He was quite frightened of her, and said
that she shook him as roughly as though he were a bundle of
linen.</p>

<p>'Don't call for me again then, sir,' she said as she bounced
angrily out of the room. 'If you won't let anybody help you,
you must attend to yourself!'</p>

<p>Thereupon Pauline gently glided up to the bedside, and
with delicate skilfulness lightened the pressure of the bed-clothes
with her childish fingers. The sufferer felt a short
respite from his agony, and accepted the girl's help with a
smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>'Thank you, my dear. Stay! stay! Ah! that fold there
weighs five hundred pounds! Oh! not so quickly, my dear,
you quite frightened me.'</p>

<p>Then his agony returned in full force again; and as his wife,
trying to find some occupation in the room, first drew up the
blinds and then bustled to his bedside and placed a cup on the
little table, he grew still more querulous.</p>

<p>'Oh! do keep still; don't rush about so! You make
everything shake and tremble. Every step you take is just like
a blow on my head with a hammer.'</p>

<p>She made no attempt at apologising or soothing him.
Matters always ended in this fashion, and he was left to suffer
in solitude.</p>

<p>'Come along, Pauline,' she said, quite unconcernedly. 'You
see that your uncle can't endure to have any of us near him.'</p>

<p>But Pauline stayed behind in the sick-room. She glided
about with such a light step that her feet scarcely seemed
to touch the floor. From that moment she installed herself
there as the sick man's nurse, and she was the only person
whose presence in the room he could endure. She seemed
able to read his thoughts, and she anticipated all his wants,
softening the light as occasion seemed to require, and giving
him his gruel, which Véronique brought as far as the door.
But what the poor man found especially soothing and
comforting was to see her constantly before him, sitting
thoughtfully and quietly on her chair, with her big sympathetic
eyes ever fixed upon him. He tried to find some distraction
from his weariness in telling her of his sufferings.</p>

<p>'Just now I feel as if someone were sawing away at the
joints of my toes with a jagged knife, and at the same time I
could almost swear that I was being drenched with warm
water.'</p>

<p>Then the character of his agony changed. It seemed as
though a steel wire were twisted tightly round his ankle, and
he could feel his muscles being strained till they were on the
point of breaking. Pauline listened with affectionate complaisance
and seemed to fully understand all he told her,
remaining ever placid amongst all his groanings, with no other
thought than to do what she could to alleviate his pain. She
even forced herself to appear gay, and actually succeeded in
making him laugh between his paroxysms.</p>

<p>When Doctor Cazenove at last arrived, he was filled with
admiration of the little nurse, and gave her a hearty kiss upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
her head. The Doctor was a man of fifty-four, vigorous and
lean, who, after thirty years' service in the navy, had just
settled down at Arromanches, where an uncle had left him a
house. He had been a friend of the Chanteaus ever since he
had cured Madame Chanteau of an awkward sprain.</p>

<p>'Well! well! here I am again!' he said. 'I have just
come in to shake hands; but, you know, I can do nothing
more for you than the little girl is already doing. When one
has inherited gout, and has got past one's fiftieth year, one
must reconcile oneself to it. And then, you know, you ruined
your constitution with the shopful of drugs you swallowed.
The only remedies are patience and flannel!'</p>

<p>The Doctor affected utter scepticism of the power of
medicine in such a case. In thirty years he had seen so
many poor sufferers racked with pain and disease, in all sorts
of climates and in all kinds of surroundings, that he had
grown very modest about his power to afford any actual relief.
He generally preferred to let Nature work out its own cure.
However, he carefully examined Chanteau's swollen toe,
whose gleaming skin had turned a deep red, went on to look
at the knee which was threatened with inflammation, and
finally took note of the presence of a little pearl-like deposit,
white and hard, at the edge of the patient's right ear.</p>

<p>'But, Doctor,' groaned the sufferer, 'you are not going to
leave me suffering like this?'</p>

<p>Cazenove's demeanour had become quite serious. That
chalky bead interested him, and his faith in medical science
returned at the sight of this new symptom. 'Dear me' he
murmured half to himself, 'I had better try what salts and
alkalies will do. It is evidently becoming chronic.'</p>

<p>Then in a louder and angry tone he said: 'It is your own
fault, you know. You won't follow the directions I have given
you. You are always glued to your arm-chair, and you never
think of taking any exercise. And then I dare say you have
been drinking wine and eating too much meat. Eh! haven't
you, now? Confess that you have been taking something
heating!'</p>

<p>'Nothing but a tiny bit of <i>foie gras</i>,' murmured Chanteau,
very humbly.</p>

<p>The Doctor raised both his arms, as though to call the
elements to witness his patient's folly. Then he took some
little phials from the pockets of his overcoat, and began to
prepare a draught. By way of local treatment he simply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
wrapped the foot and knee in cotton-wool, which he kept in
its place by twisting some waxed thread round it. When he
went away, it was to Pauline that he gave his directions. The
invalid was to have a tablespoonful of the draught every two
hours, and as much gruel as he liked, but he must observe the
greatest strictness in the matter of diet.</p>

<p>'If you suppose that anybody can keep him from eating
anything he chooses, you are very much mistaken,' said
Madame Chanteau, as she went with the Doctor to the door.</p>

<p>'No! no! aunt dear; he will be very good, you will see,'
Pauline ventured to assert. 'I will make him do what is
right.'</p>

<p>Cazenove looked at her, and was amused by her serious
manner. He kissed her again, on both her cheeks this
time.</p>

<p>'There's a good little girl,' he said, 'who came into the
world on purpose to help others.'</p>

<p>For a whole week Chanteau lay groaning. Just when the
attack seemed over, his right foot was seized by the foe,
and all his agony returned with increased violence. The whole
house rang with his cries. Véronique kept in the depths of
her kitchen so as to escape the sound of them, and Madame
Chanteau and Lazare sometimes actually ran out of the house,
quite overcome by nervous excitement. It was only Pauline
who remained with the sick man, and she indeed never left
his room. She was ever struggling with his foolish whims
and fancies; as, for instance, when he furiously insisted upon
having a cutlet cooked, saying that he was very hungry, and
roundly declaring that Doctor Cazenove was an ass and didn't
know what was good for him. The night was the worst time,
for then the attacks seemed to come on with increased violence.
Pauline could only snatch some two or three hours' sleep.
But, in spite of it all, she retained her spirits, and her health
did not seem in any way to suffer. Madame Chanteau readily
accepted her services, until, when Chanteau was again convalescent,
the girl at last regained her liberty; and then a
close companionship sprang up between her and Lazare.</p>

<p>It took its rise in that by-room which the young man
occupied upstairs. He had had a partition knocked down,
and so this room of his covered half of the second storey.
A little iron bedstead was hidden away behind a tattered
old screen. Against the wall and on the bare floor-boards
were piled a thousand volumes of books, classical works,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
largely imperfect sets, which had been discovered in a lumber-room
at Caen and had been transported to Bonneville. Near
the window there was a huge antique Norman wardrobe
crammed with all kinds of out-of-the-way objects, specimens
of minerals, old and useless tools, and broken toys. There
was a piano, also, over which were hung a pair of foils
and a fencing-mask; and there was an enormous table in the
centre, an old high drawing-table, so completely littered with
papers, engravings, tobacco-jars and pipes that it was difficult
to find a hand's-breadth of space available for writing.</p>

<p>Pauline was delighted when she was given the freedom
of this wild chaos. She spent a month in exploring it
thoroughly, and every day she made some new discovery,
such as an illustrated 'Robinson Crusoe' which she came upon
in rummaging amongst the books, or a doll which she fished
out of the miscellaneous collection in the cupboard. As soon
as she was dressed of a morning, she sprang out of her own
room into her cousin's and settled herself there; and in the
afternoon she often returned thither again.</p>

<p>From the day of her first visit Lazare had received her
as though she had been a boy, a younger brother, some nine
years his junior, but so merry and amusing and with such
big intelligent eyes as to be in no wise in his way; and as
usual he went on smoking his pipe, lolling in his chair with
his legs cocked up in the air, or reading, or writing long
letters into which he slipped flowers. Sometimes they made
a pretty riot between them, for Pauline had a habit of
suddenly springing upon the table or bounding through the
split folds of the old screen. One morning as Lazare wondered
why he did not hear her, and turned to ascertain
what she might be about, he saw her, foil in hand, with her
face screened with the fencing-mask as she flourished away
at space. Whenever he told her to be still or threatened
to turn her out of the room, the result was a tremendous
skirmish and a wild pursuit through the disorderly place.
Then she would fly at him and throw her arms on his neck,
and he twirled her round like a top, with her petticoats
circling about her. As the room echoed with their merry
child-like laughter, he felt quite a boy again himself.</p>

<p>Next the piano afforded them occupation. It was an old
instrument of Érard's make, dating from the year 1810, and
upon it, in former times, Mademoiselle Eugénie de la Vignière
had given lessons for fifteen years. The strings in its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
mahogany case, from which most of the polish had departed,
sighed out far-away tones of a muffled softness. Lazare,
who had never been able to persuade his mother to get him a
new piano, strummed away on the old instrument with all his
might, without succeeding in eliciting from it the sonorous
rhapsodies buzzing in his head; and he had got into the
habit of adding the notes of his own voice to the instrument's
in order to obtain the required volume of sound. His
passion for music soon led him to abuse Pauline's easy
complaisance. He had found a listener, and for whole afternoons
he kept her there while he went through his <i>répertoire</i>,
which comprised all that was most complicated in music, and
notably the then unacknowledged scores of Berlioz and
Wagner. He poured forth his vocal accompaniment, and, as
his enthusiasm increased, rendered the piece quite as much
with his throat as with his fingers. On these occasions the
poor child used to feel dreadfully bored, but she went on
listening with an air of rapt attention, so that she might
not hurt her cousin's feelings.</p>

<p>Sometimes darkness would surprise them still at the piano,
and then Lazare would leave off playing and tell Pauline of
his dreams for the future. He would be a great musician in
spite of his mother, in spite of everybody. At the college at
Caen a professor of the violin, struck by his genius for music,
had prophesied a glorious career for him. He had secretly
taken private lessons in composition, and now he was working
hard by himself. He already had in his head a vague outline
of a symphony on the subject of the Earthly Paradise; and,
indeed, he had actually written the score of one passage descriptive
of Adam and Eve being driven away by the angels,
a march of a solemn and mournful character, which he
consented to play one evening to Pauline. The child quite
approved of it and declared it delightful. Then, however, she
began to talk to him; of course it must be very nice, she
said, to compose pretty music, but wouldn't it be more
prudent if he were to obey the wishes of his parents, who
wanted to make him a prefect or a judge? The whole house
was made unhappy by the quarrel between the mother and
the son; he declaring that he would go to Paris to the Conservatoire,
and she replying that she would just give him till
next October to make up his mind to embrace some respectable
profession. Pauline backed up her aunt's designs, and
told her, with an air of tranquil conviction, that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
take upon herself to bring her cousin round to proper views.
She indeed argued the matter with Lazare, who grew angry
with her and violently closed the piano, telling her that she
was 'a horrid <i>bourgeoise</i>.'</p>

<p>For three days they sulked with each other, and then made
friends again. To win her over to his musical scheme, Lazare
wished to teach her to play on the piano. He showed her
how to place her fingers on the keys, and kept her for hours
running up and down the scales. But she discouraged him
very much by her lack of enthusiasm. She was always on
the look-out for something to laugh at and make a joke of,
and took great delight in making Minouche promenade along
the key-board and execute barbaric symphonies with her
paws, asserting that the cat was playing the famous banishment
from the Earthly Paradise, whereat the composer
himself smiled. Then they broke out into boisterous fun
again, she threw her arms round his neck, and he spun her
round like a top, while Minouche, joining in the merriment,
sprang from the table to the top of the cupboard. As for
Matthew, he was not admitted into the room, as he was apt
to become over-riotous when he felt merry.</p>

<p>'You drive me crazy, you wretched little shopkeeper!'
Lazare one day broke out, quite impatiently. 'You had
better get my mother to teach you, if you can persuade her to
do so.'</p>

<p>'All this music of yours will never do you any good, you
know,' Pauline answered quite roundly. 'If I were you I
would be a doctor.'</p>

<p>He stared at her fiercely. A doctor, indeed! What had
put that idea into her head? He worked himself into a state
of excitement that made him lose all self-control.</p>

<p>'Listen to me!' he cried. 'If they won't let me be a
musician, I'll kill myself!'</p>

<p>The summer completed Chanteau's restoration to health,
and Pauline was now able to follow Lazare in his rambles out
of doors. The big room was deserted, and they set off on
wild adventures together. For some days they confined
themselves to the terrace, where vegetated tufts of tamarisks,
which the salt winds had nipped and blighted. Then they
invaded the yard, broke the chain belonging to the well,
terrified the dozen skinny fowls that lived upon grasshoppers,
and hid themselves in the empty stable and coach-house and
knocked the plaster off the walls. Thence they slipped into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the kitchen-garden, a bit of poor dry ground, which Véronique
dug and hoed like a peasant. There were four beds sown
with tough vegetables and planted with miserable stumps of
pear-trees, which were all bent by the north-west gales. And
while here, on pushing open a little door, they found themselves
on the cliffs, under the broad sky, with the open sea in
front of them. Pauline's absorbing interest in that mighty
expanse of water, now so soft and pure under the bright July
sun, had never diminished. It was always for the sea that she
looked from every window in the house. But she had never
yet been near it, and a new era in her life commenced when
she found herself alone with Lazare in the solitude of the
shore.</p>

<p>What happy times they had together! Madame Chanteau
grumbled and wanted to keep them in the house, in spite of
all her confidence in Pauline's discretion; and so they never
went out through the yard, where Véronique would have seen
them, but glided stealthily through the kitchen-garden, and
so escaped, to appear no more till evening. They soon found
their rambles round the church and the graveyard, with
its shadowing yews and the priest's salad-beds, a trifle
monotonous, and in a week they had quite exhausted the
attractions of Bonneville, with its thirty cottages clinging to
the side of the cliff and its strip of shingle where the fishermen
drew up their boats. When the tide was low it was far
more amusing to wander along at the foot of the cliffs. They
walked over fine sand, frightening the little crabs that
scudded away before them, or jumped from rock to rock
among the thick seaweed and the sparkling pools where
shrimps were skimming about; to say nothing of the fish
they caught, of the mussels they ate, raw and even without
bread, or the strange-looking creatures they carried away in
their handkerchiefs, or the odd discoveries they sometimes
made, such as that of a stranded dab or a little lobster lurking
at the bottom of a hole. They would sometimes let themselves
be overtaken by the rising tide and rush merrily for
refuge to some big rock, to wait there till the ebb allowed
them to go their way again. They were perfectly happy as
they came back home in the evening wet through and with
their hair all tossed about by the wind. And they grew so
accustomed to this life in the fresh salt breezes that they
found the atmosphere of the lamp-lighted room at night quite
suffocating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>But their greatest pleasure of all was bathing. The beach
was too rocky to attract the inhabitants of Caen and Bayeux,
and, whereas every year new villas rose on the cliffs at
Arromanches, never a single bather made his appearance at
Bonneville. Lazare and Pauline had discovered, about half
a mile from the village, over towards Port-en-Bessin, a
delightful spot, a little bay shut in by two rocky cliffs and
carpeted with soft glittering sand. They called it the Golden
Bay, for its secluded waves seemed to wash up pieces of
glittering gold. They were quite alone and undisturbed there,
and undressed and slipped on their bathing things without
any feeling of shame. Lazare in a week taught Pauline to
swim. She was much more enthusiastic about this than she
had been about the piano, and in her plucky attempts she
often swallowed big mouthfuls of salt water. If a larger wave
than usual sent them tottering one against the other, they
laughed gleefully; and when they came out of the water, they
went romping over the sand till the wind had dried them.
This was much more amusing than fishing.</p>

<p>The days slipped away, however, and August came round,
and as yet Lazare had come to no decision. In October
Pauline was to go to a boarding-school at Bayeux. When
bathing had tired them, they would sit on the sand and talk
over the state of their affairs gravely and sensibly. Pauline
had succeeded in interesting Lazare in medical matters by
telling him that if she were a man she should think nothing
nobler or more delightful than to be able to cure ailing
people. Besides, for the last week or so, the Earthly Paradise
had not been getting on satisfactorily, and Lazare was
beginning to have doubts about his genius for music. At
any rate, there had been great glory won in the practice of
medicine, and he bethought him of many illustrious names,
Hippocrates, Ambrose Paré, and others.</p>

<p>One afternoon, however, he burst out into a loud cry of
delight. He had the score of his masterpiece in his hand at
the time. It was all rubbish, he said, that Paradise of his,
and could not be worked out. He would destroy it all, and
write quite a new symphony on Grief, which should describe
in sublime harmonies the hopeless despair of Humanity
groaning beneath the skies. He retained the march of Adam
and Eve, and boldly transferred it to his new work as the
'March of Death.' For a week his enthusiasm increased
every hour, and the whole universe entered into the scheme<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
of his symphony. But, when another week had passed away,
Pauline was very much astonished to hear him say one
evening that he was quite willing to go and study medicine in
Paris. He was really thinking that by doing so he would be
near the Conservatoire, and would then be able to see what
could be done. Madame Chanteau, however, was delighted.
She would certainly have preferred seeing her son hold some
judicial or administrative office, but, at any rate, doctors were
very respectable persons and sometimes made a good deal of
money. 'You must be a little witch!' she said, kissing
Pauline; 'you have more than repaid us, my dear, for taking
you.'</p>

<p>Everything was settled. Lazare was to leave on the
1st of October. During the month of September that
remained to them they gave themselves up with greater
fervour than ever to their romps and rambles, resolved to
finish their term of freedom in a worthy manner. They
sported about in the Golden Bay at times till darkness surprised
them there.</p>

<p>One evening they were sitting on the beach, watching the
stars appear like fiery beads in the paling sky. Pauline
gazed at them with the placid admiration of a healthy child,
whereas Lazare, who had become feverish ever since he had
been preparing for his departure, blinked nervously, while in his
mind revolved all kinds of schemes and ambitions for the future.</p>

<p>'How lovely the stars are!' said Pauline quietly, after a
long interval of silence.</p>

<p>He made no reply. All his cheerfulness had left him;
his gaze seemed disturbed by some inward anxiety. Up
in the sky the stars were growing thicker every minute, as if
sparks were being cast by the handful across the heavens.</p>

<p>'You have never learned anything about them, have
you?' he said at last. 'Each star up yonder is a sun, round
which there are planets wheeling like the earth. There are
thousands and thousands of them; and far away beyond
those you can see are legions of others. There is no end to
them.' Then he became silent for a moment. By-and-by
he resumed in a voice that quivered with emotion: 'I don't
like to look at them; they make me feel afraid.'</p>

<p>The rising tide was raising a distant wail, like the mournful
cry of a multitude lamenting its wretchedness. Over the
horizon, black now with fallen night, glittered the gold-dust
of wheeling worlds. And amid that sad wail that echoed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
round them from the world, pressed low beneath the countless
stars, Pauline thought she detected a sound of bitter sobbing
beside her.</p>

<p>'What is the matter with you? Are you ill?'</p>

<p>Lazare made no answer. He was indeed sobbing, with
his face hidden in his convulsively twitching hands, as
though he wanted to blot out the sight of everything. And
as soon as he was able to speak, he gasped: 'Oh, to die!
to die!'</p>

<p>The scene filled Pauline with long-lasting astonishment.
Lazare rose to his feet with difficulty, and they went back to
Bonneville through the darkness, the rising tide pressing closely
upon them. Neither spoke a word to the other. As Pauline
watched the young man go on in front of her, he seemed to
grow shorter, to bend beneath the breeze from the west.</p>

<p>That evening they found a new-comer waiting for them in
the dining-room, talking to Chanteau. For a week past they
had been expecting the arrival of a young girl called Louise,
who was eleven years and a half old, and came to spend a
fortnight every year at Bonneville. They had twice gone to
meet her at Arromanches, without finding her, and now, that
evening, when no one was looking for her, she had turned up
quite unexpectedly. Louise's mother had died in Madame
Chanteau's arms, recommending her daughter to the other's
care. Her father, Monsieur Thibaudier, a banker at Caen,
had married again six months afterwards, and had already
three children by his present wife. Absorbed by his new
family and business matters, he had sent Louise to a boarding-school,
and was only too glad when he could get her off his
hands during the holidays by sending her upon a round of
visits to her friends. He gave himself as little trouble about
her as possible, and she had come to the Chanteaus' a week
behind her time, in the charge of a servant. 'The master had
so much to worry him,' said the latter, who returned home
immediately she had deposited her charge at Bonneville, with
an intimation that Mademoiselle's father would do his best to
come and fetch her himself when her time was up.</p>

<p>'Come along, Lazare!' cried Chanteau. 'Here she is at
last!'</p>

<p>Louise smiled and kissed the young man on both his
cheeks, though the acquaintance between them was slight, for
she had been constantly shut up in school, and it was barely
a year since he had left college. Their knowledge of each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
other really dated from their last holidays, and Lazare had
hitherto treated the girl somewhat ceremoniously, fancying
that she already considered herself grown-up, and despised
any youthful display of boisterousness.</p>

<p>'Well, Pauline, aren't you going to kiss her?' said
Chanteau, entering the room. 'She is older than you by a
year and a half, you know. You must be very fond of each
other; it will please me very much to see you so.'</p>

<p>Pauline looked keenly at Louise, who was slight and
delicate, with somewhat irregular though very pleasing
features. Her hair was thick and fair, and was curled and
arranged like that of a young woman. Pauline turned a little
pale on seeing Louise kiss Lazare; and when she herself was
kissed by her with a smile, it was with quivering lips that
she returned the salute.</p>

<p>'What is the matter with you?' asked her aunt. 'Are
you cold?'</p>

<p>'Yes, I think I am a little. The wind was rather chilly,'
she answered, blushing at the falsehood she was telling.</p>

<p>When they sat down to dinner she ate nothing. Her eyes
never strayed from the faces of those who were present, and
became very black whenever her uncle or her cousin or even
Véronique paid any attention to Louise. But she seemed to
be especially pained when Matthew, making his customary
round of the table, went and laid his huge head upon the
new-comer's knee. It was quite in vain that she called him
to her. He would not leave Louise, who gorged him with
sugar.</p>

<p>When they rose from the table, Pauline immediately left
the room. Véronique was clearing the things away, and as
she came back from the kitchen for a fresh trayful she said,
with a triumphant expression: 'Ah, Madame! I know you
think your Pauline quite perfect, but just go and look at her
now in the yard.'</p>

<p>They all went out to see. Hiding away behind the coach-house,
Pauline was holding Matthew against the wall, and,
apparently mad with passion, was hitting his head with all
the strength of her clenched fists. The poor dog seemed
quite stupefied, and, instead of offering resistance to her
blows, simply hung down his head. They rushed out at her,
but even at their approach she did not desist from her cruel
treatment, and they were obliged to carry her off. She was
found to be in such a feverish, excited state that she was at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
once put to bed, and for the greater part of the night her
aunt dared not leave her.</p>

<p>'Oh! yes, she's a dear little thing, a very dear little
thing!' sneered Véronique, who was quite delighted at having
discovered a flaw in the diamond.</p>

<p>'I remember, now,' said Madame Chanteau, 'that people
spoke to me about her outbursts of temper when I was in
Paris. She is quite jealous&mdash;what a nasty thing! I have
noticed during the six months that she has been with us
several trifling matters that haven't pleased me; but, really,
to try to murder the poor dog beats everything!'</p>

<p>When Pauline saw Matthew the next day, she threw her
trembling arms round him and, kissing him on the nose, burst
into such a flood of tears that they feared she was going to
have another hysterical attack. In spite of her repentance,
she could not restrain these outbursts of mad passion. It
was as though some sudden storm within her sent all her
blood boiling and hissing into her head. She had doubtless
inherited this jealous violence from some ancestor on her
mother's side; yet she had a deal of common-sense for a child
of ten years old, and used to say that she did all she could to
struggle against those outbreaks, but without avail. They
made her very miserable, as though they had been the
symptoms of some shameful disease.</p>

<p>At times, when Madame Chanteau reproached her, she
replied, hiding her head against her aunt's shoulder: 'I love
you so much, why do you love others?'</p>

<p>Thus, in spite of all her efforts and struggles, Pauline
suffered a great deal from Louise's presence in the house.
Ever since the other had been expected, she had been
looking forward to her coming with uneasy curiosity, and now
she was impatiently counting the days of her stay, all eagerness
for her departure. Yet she could not help remarking
the charm of Louise's manner, the pretty seductiveness of her
half-childish, half-womanish demeanour; but, perhaps, it was
this very charm and seductiveness that troubled her and made
her so angry when Lazare was present. For his part, the
young man showed the greater preference for Pauline, and
even made jokes about Louise, saying that she wearied him
with her grand airs, and that Pauline and he had better leave
her alone to play the fine lady by herself, while they went off
somewhere to amuse themselves as they liked. All boisterous
romping had ceased since Louise's arrival; indoors they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
remained looking at pictures, and when they went to the
shore they walked about with irreproachable decorum. It
was a fortnight utterly wasted.</p>

<p>One morning Lazare announced his intention of anticipating
his departure by five days. He was anxious, he said,
to get settled down in Paris, where he expected to find one of
his old chums at the College of Caen. Pauline, whom the
thought of the approaching separation had distressed for a
month past, now strongly approved of her cousin's determination,
and gleefully assisted her aunt to pack his trunk. But
as soon as he had driven off in old Malivoire's ancient <i>berline</i>
she rushed away to her room, locked herself in it, and gave
herself up to weeping. Then, in the evening, she bore herself
very kindly and affectionately towards Louise, and the remaining
week which the latter spent at Bonneville passed away
delightfully. When the maid came to fetch her home again,
explaining that the banker had not been able to leave his
business, the two girls rushed into each other's arms and
swore eternal friendship.</p>

<p>A year slowly passed away. Madame Chanteau had
changed her mind, and, instead of sending Pauline to a
boarding-school, had kept her at home with herself, being
chiefly moved to this course by the complaints of Chanteau,
who had grown so used to the girl that he declared he could
not possibly get on without her. But the good lady did not
confess that any such reason of self-interest had anything to
do with the alteration of her plans; she talked about undertaking
the child's education herself, feeling quite youthful
again at the thought of reverting to her old profession of
tuition. Besides, in boarding-schools, said she, little girls
became acquainted with all kinds of things, and she wished
her young ward to be reared in perfect innocence and purity.
They hunted out from among Lazare's miscellaneous books
a Grammar, an Arithmetic, a Treatise on History, and even
an Abridgment of the Greek Mythology; and Madame
Chanteau resumed her functions of preceptress. Lazare's
big room was turned into a schoolroom; Pauline had to
resume her music lessons there, and was put through a severe
course of deportment to rid her of all the unladylike, boyish
ways into which she had fallen. She showed herself very
docile and intelligent, and manifested a great willingness to
learn, even when the subject-matter of her lessons was distasteful
to her. There was only one thing which seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
weary her, and that was the catechism. She had not as yet
supposed that her aunt would take the trouble to conduct her
to mass on Sundays. Why should she, indeed? When she
lived in Paris, no one had ever taken her to Saint-Eustache,
which was quite near their house. It was only with difficulty
that abstract ideas found their way into her understanding,
and her aunt had to explain to her that a well brought-up
young lady's duty in the country was to set a proper example
by showing herself to be on good terms with the priest.
Religion, with her, had never been anything more than a
matter of appearance and respectability, and she looked upon
it as part of a polite education, standing upon very much the
same footing as the art of deportment.</p>

<p>Twice every day the tide swept up to the cliffs of Bonneville,
and Pauline's life passed on with the great expanse of surging
water before her eyes. She had given over playing and
romping, for she no longer had a companion. When she had
run along the terrace with Matthew, or strolled to the end of
the kitchen-garden with Minouche, her only pleasure was to
go and gaze at the sea, which was full of changing life, dark
and gloomy in the stormy days of winter, and gleaming with
bright blues and greens beneath the summer sun. The
beneficent influence which seemed to flow from the girl's
presence in the house manifested itself in another form that
year, for Chanteau received from Davoine a quite unlooked-for
remittance of five thousand francs, which threats of a
dissolution of partnership had extorted from him. Madame
Chanteau never missed going to Caen each quarter to receive
her niece's dividends, and when she had deducted her expenses
and the sum which she was allowed for Pauline's board, she
invested the balance in the purchase of further stock. On
returning home she always took the girl into her room, and,
opening the well-known drawer in the secrétaire, said to her:
'There, you see, I am putting this with the other. Isn't it
getting a big heap? Don't be at all uneasy about it. You
will find it all there when you want it. There won't be a
centime missing.'</p>

<p>One fine morning in August Lazare suddenly made his appearance,
bringing with him the news of his complete success
in his preliminary examinations. He had not been expected
for another week, but he had wanted to take his mother by
surprise. His arrival greatly delighted them all. In the
letters which he had written home every fortnight he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
shown an increasing interest in medicine, and, now that he was
amongst them again, he appeared to be completely changed.
He never spoke a word about music, but was perpetually
chattering about his professors and his scientific studies, dragging
them in <i>à propos</i> of everything, even of the dishes that
were served at dinner and the direction in which the wind was
blowing. He was, now, a prey to another wildly enthusiastic
ambition, for he dreamed, day and night, of becoming a
physician, whose wonderful skill would be trumpeted through
the whole world. Pauline, when she had thrown her arms
round his neck and kissed him with child-like frankness, was
more surprised than the others at this change in him. It
almost grieved her, indeed, that he should have dropped all
his interest in music, even as a recreation. Could it be
possible, she asked herself, that, when one had really loved
anything, one could end by caring nothing at all about it?
One day when she asked him about his symphony, he began to
make fun of it, and told her that he had quite done with all
such nonsense. She felt quite sad at those words. But
he also seemed to be soon bored with her society, and
laughed with an unpleasant laugh; while his eyes and his
gestures spoke of a ten months' life which could not have
been related in detail to little girls.</p>

<p>He had unpacked his trunk himself, so as to keep from view
the books he had brought home with him, novels and medical
works, some of them copiously illustrated. He no longer
twirled his cousin like a top, as he had been wont to do,
making her petticoats fly in a circle round her, and he even
seemed quite confused at times when she persisted in coming
into his room and staying there. However, she had scarcely
grown at all during his absence, and she still looked him
frankly in the face with her pure innocent eyes, in such wise
that by the end of a week his appearance of uneasiness had
vanished, and they reverted to their old intimacy and comradeship.
The fresh sea-breezes had now swept the unhealthy
influences of the students' quarter of Paris out of Lazare's
brain, and he felt once more a child himself as he romped
about with his little cousin, both of them full of vigorous
health and gaiety. All the old life began anew; the racing
round the table, the scampers with Matthew and Minouche
through the garden, the rambles to the Golden Bay and the
bathing in the open air. And that year, too, Louise, who had
paid a visit to Bonneville in May, went to take her holidays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
with some other friends at Rouen; and so the others spent
two very delightful months, without a single disagreement
or misunderstanding to mar their enjoyment. When October
came, Pauline watched Lazare pack his trunk for his return
to Paris. He gathered together the books he had brought
with him, which had remained stowed away in his cupboard
without once being opened.</p>

<p>'Are you going to take them all back with you?' the
girl asked in a melancholy voice.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed,' he replied. 'I shall want them all for my
studies. You have no notion how hard I am going to work.
I shall want every one of them.'</p>

<p>The little house at Bonneville once more subsided into
lifeless, monotonous quietude. Each day passed in precisely
the same way as its predecessors, bringing the same round
of incidents beside the ceaseless rhythm of the ocean. That
year, however, was marked distinctly for Pauline. In the
month of June she took her first communion, being then
twelve and a half years old. By slow degrees a religious
feeling had taken possession of her, but it was a religious
feeling loftier than the one indicated in her catechism, whose
answers she constantly repeated without understanding them.
With her reflective young mind she had ended by picturing
the Deity to herself as a very powerful and very wise ruler,
who directed everything upon earth in accordance with
principles of strict justice; and this simplified conception of
hers sufficed to put her on a footing of understanding with
Abbé Horteur. The Abbé was a peasant's son, and into his
hard head nothing but the letter of the law had ever made
its way. He had grown to be contented with the observance
of outward ceremonies and the maintenance of religious
practices. True, he bestowed the greatest care and thought
upon his own salvation; and if his parishioners should finally
be damned, well, it would be their own fault. For fifteen years
he had been trying to terrify them without success, and now
all that he asked of them was to come to church on the
great feast days. And, in spite of the sinful state in which
it rotted, Bonneville did come to church pretty regularly,
drawn thither by the influence of old habit. But the priest's
tolerance had degenerated into indifference as to the real
spiritual condition of his flock. Every Saturday it was
his custom to go and play draughts with Chanteau, although
the mayor, making his gout an excuse, never set foot inside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
the church. But then Madame Chanteau did all that was
necessary by attending the services regularly and taking
Pauline with her. It was the priest's great simplicity and
frankness which by degrees won Pauline over. While living
in Paris, she had heard priests scoffed and sneered at as
hypocrites, whose black robes concealed all manner of sins
and wickedness. But the priest of that little sea-side hamlet
seemed to her a thoroughly genuine, honest fellow, with his
heavy boots and sun-browned neck and farmer-like speech and
manner. One little fact especially impressed her. Abbé
Horteur was strongly addicted to puffing away at a big
meerschaum pipe, but he seemed to be disturbed by some
slight scruples as to the propriety of such a habit, for whenever
he wanted to smoke he always retired into his garden,
and hid himself away in the solitude of his lettuce-beds.
And it was the anxious air with which he hastily tried to put
his pipe out of sight when he was taken unawares in his
garden that touched the girl, though she could scarcely have
told why. She took her first communion in a very serious
and reverent frame of mind, in company with two other girls
from the village and one boy. When the priest came to dine
with the Chanteaus in the evening, he declared that never
since he had been at Bonneville had he seen a communicant
who had conducted herself with such reverence at the Holy
Table.</p>

<p>Financially, the year was not so prosperous for the
Chanteaus. The rise in the price of deal, for which Davoine
had been hoping for a long time past, did not take place, and
so only bad news came from Caen, for, being driven into
selling at a loss, the business was in a bad way indeed. Thus
the family lived in the most meagre fashion, and were only
able to make their income of three thousand francs cover the
necessary expenses by practising the most rigid economy.
Lazare, whose letters to herself she kept strictly private, was
Madame Chanteau's chief source of anxiety. He was apparently
leading a life of extravagance and dissipation, for he
constantly applied to her for money. When she went to Caen
in July to receive Pauline's dividend, she made a fierce attack
upon Davoine. Two thousand francs which he had previously
given to her had been sent to Lazare, and now
she succeeded in wringing another thousand francs out of
him, and these she at once despatched to Paris. For Lazare
had written to tell her that he would not be able to come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
home unless he was provided with the means of paying his
debts. Every day during a whole week they expected his arrival
amongst them, but each morning a letter came announcing
that his departure had been put off till the morrow. When
at last he did actually start for home, his mother and Pauline
went as far as Verchemont to meet him. They met there,
kissed each other on the high-road, and walked home together,
followed by the unoccupied coach, which carried Lazare's
luggage.</p>

<p>Lazare's return home that year was by no means so gay as
his previous triumphal surprise. He had failed to pass an
examination in July, and was embittered against all his
professors, of whom he fell foul throughout the evening.
The next morning, in Pauline's presence, he threw his books
upon one of the shelves in the wardrobe, exclaiming that they
might lie there and rot. This sudden disgust for his studies
alarmed her. She heard him scoff bitterly at medicine, and
deny its power to cure even a cold. One day when she
was attempting to defend it from his attacks, in an impulse of
youthful belief, he sneered so bitterly at her ignorance of
what she was talking about that his remarks brought a hot
blush to her cheeks. But, all the same, he said, he had
resigned himself to being a doctor; as well that kind of
humbug as any other: everything was equally stupid at
bottom. Pauline grew quite indignant and angry at the
new ideas which he had brought home with him. Where had
he got them from? From those wicked books he read, she
was quite sure; but she dared not discuss the matter fully,
held back as she was by her own ignorance, and feeling ill at
ease amidst her cousin's sneers and innuendoes and pretences
that he could not tell her everything. The holidays glided
away in perpetual misunderstandings and bickerings. In
their walks together the young man seemed to be bored,
and declared that the sea was wearisome and monotonous.
As a means of killing time, however, he had taken to writing
verses, and composed sonnets on the sea with great elaboration
and fastidiousness of rhymes. He declined to bathe,
saying that he had found that cold baths disagreed with his
constitution, for, in spite of his denial of all value to medical
science, he now indulged in the most sweeping and authoritative
opinions, condemning or curing people with a word.
About the middle of September, when they were expecting
Louise's arrival, he suddenly expressed his intention of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
returning to Paris, saying that he wished to prepare for his
examination again. He really thought that his life would be
unbearable between two little girls, and wished to get back
to the Latin Quarter. Pauline's manner to him, however,
became gentler and more submissive the more he did to vex
her. When he was rude and sought to distress her, she
merely looked at him with those tender, smiling eyes of hers,
whose soft influence was able to soothe even Chanteau when
he groaned and moaned amidst one of his attacks of gout.
She thought that her cousin was in some way out of health,
for he looked upon life like a weary old man.</p>

<p>The day before his departure Lazare manifested such
delight at the prospect of leaving Bonneville that Pauline
burst into tears.</p>

<p>'You don't love me any more now!'</p>

<p>'Don't be a goose! Haven't I got to make my way in
life? A big girl like you to be crying! The idea of it!'</p>

<p>Then she summoned up her courage again and smiled
as she said to him: 'Work hard this year, so that
when you come back again we may all be quite happy and
satisfied.'</p>

<p>'Oh! there's no good in working hard! Their examinations
are nothing but foolery. I didn't pass because I didn't
care to. I am going to hurry through with it all now, since
my lack of fortune prevents me from living a life of ease and
leisure, which is the only satisfactory life a man can lead.'</p>

<p>In the early part of October, after Louise had returned to
Caen, Pauline again resumed her lessons with her aunt.
The curriculum of her third year's studies embraced
bowdlerised French History, and Greek Mythology as
'adapted to the use of young persons.' But the girl, who
had shown such diligence in the previous year, now seemed
to have become quite sluggish and dull. Sometimes she
even went to sleep over her tasks, and her face flushed with a
hot surging of blood. A mad outburst of anger against
Véronique, who didn't like her, she declared, made her so ill
that she had to stop in bed for a couple of days. Then came
changes in herself which disquieted and distressed her.
About Christmas-time Pauline's health was such as to alarm
Madame Chanteau. But that worthy woman, from ridiculous
notions of her own, was largely to blame, as she refused to
take Doctor Cazenove's advice and talk to the girl as she
should have done. And in the result Pauline, at an important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
period in her youth, narrowly escaped being stricken with an
attack of brain-fever.</p>

<p>When she was well again and resumed her studies, she
began to affect an enthusiastic interest in the Greek
Mythology. She shut herself up in Lazare's big room&mdash;which
was still used as a schoolroom&mdash;and had to be
sent for at meal-times. When she came down, she seemed
buried in thought and quite indifferent to all that went on.
Upstairs, however, the Mythology lay quite neglected on the
table, for it was in poring over all the medical books which
Lazare had left in the old wardrobe that she now spent her
time. There were a good many of those works, and, though at
first she failed to understand all the technical terms she met
with, she plodded on through anatomy and physiology, and even
pathology and clinical medicine. Thus she not only learnt&mdash;in
all simplicity and purity of mind, saved from all vicious
thought by a healthy craving for knowledge&mdash;many things of
which girls of her age are usually ignorant; but her researches
extended to the symptoms and treatment of all sorts of disease
and ailment. Superfluous subjects she passed by unheeded.
She seemed to know intuitively what knowledge was necessary
to enable her to be of assistance to those who suffered.
Her heart melted with pity as she read on, and she gave herself
up again to her old dream of learning everything so that
she might be able to cure all that went amiss.</p>

<p>Knowledge rendered Pauline grave and thoughtful. She
felt surprised and annoyed at her aunt's silence towards her,
which had resulted in such terror and serious illness. And
when one day Madame Chanteau did see fit to refer to the
matter, the girl quietly intimated that she needed no information.
At this the other was alarmed, and Pauline then told
her all about Lazare's books. There was a scene, but the girl,
with her outspoken frankness, quite routed her aunt. 'How
can there be harm in knowledge of the normal conditions of
life?' she asked. Her enthusiasm was perfectly mental, and
never did a single wrong thought disturb the pure depths of
her clear, child-like eyes. On the same shelf with the medical
books she had found novels which had repelled her and bored
her, so that she had thrown them aside after glancing at the
first few pages. Her aunt, growing more and more disconcerted,
though she had recovered a little from her first shock,
contented herself with locking the wardrobe and taking away
the key. But a week later it was there again, and Pauline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
indulged herself in reading at intervals, by way of recreation,
either a chapter on neurosis, with her mind fixed the while
upon her cousin, or one relating to the treatment of gout,
with the idea of undertaking her uncle's cure.</p>

<p>Each day increasing love of life and its various manifestations
displayed itself in Pauline and made of her, to use
her aunt's phrase, a general mother. Everything that lived,
everything that suffered, aroused in her a feeling of active
tenderness and won from her abundant kindliness and
thoughtful care. She had now forgotten all about Paris, and
began to feel as though she had been born in that wild spot
under the pure breezes from the sea. She had developed, too,
into a well-formed young woman, and with her healthy mind
and love of knowledge it was with delight that she found herself
reaching full growth and sunny ripeness. On her part
there was a full acceptance of life, life beloved in all its
functions, welcomed with the triumphant greeting of vigorous
health and soundness of nature.</p>

<p>That year Lazare remained for six months without
writing home, with the exception, that is, of a very brief note
now and then to tell them he was all right. Then all at once
he began to deluge his mother with letters. He had again
been plucked at the November examination, and had become
more disgusted than ever with the study of medicine, which
dealt with too gloomy matters for his taste, so that he had
now enthusiastically turned to chemistry. He had chanced
to make the acquaintance of the illustrious Herbelin, whose
discoveries were then revolutionising the science, and had
entered his laboratory as an assistant, without owning, however,
that he was relinquishing medicine. But his letters
were soon full of a new scheme, which he at first mentioned
somewhat timidly, but gradually grew wildly enthusiastic
about. It was a plan for turning sea-weed to wonderful profit,
by the adoption of some new methods and reagents discovered
by the illustrious Herbelin. Lazare dwelt upon the great
probability of the scheme's success; the great chemist's
assistance; the ease with which raw material could be
obtained, and the very small expense that would be incurred
for plant. In the end he frankly expressed his disinclination
to be a doctor, and jokingly declared that he should prefer to
sell remedies to the sick rather than to kill them off himself.
He finished all his letters by recapitulating the prospects of
speedily acquiring a large fortune, and mentioned as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
additional lure to his parents that, if they would consent to
his new plans, he should remain with them, as he proposed
setting up his works quite close to Bonneville.</p>

<p>The months slipped away, and Lazare did not come home
for the vacation. All through the winter he continued to
unfold the details of his new scheme in long closely-written
letters, which Madame Chanteau used to read aloud in the
evening after dinner. One night in May they resolved themselves
into a solemn family council to discuss the matter
seriously, for Lazare had written to ask for a categorical reply.
Véronique was bustling about the room, taking off the dinner-cloth
and putting the red one on the table in its place.</p>

<p>'He is his grandfather over again, always running after
some fresh scheme and doing no good at anything,' declared
Madame Chanteau, glancing up at the former journeyman-carpenter's
masterpiece, whose presence on the mantelshelf
was a perpetual source of annoyance to her.</p>

<p>'Well, he certainly doesn't get his flighty disposition
from me, for I detest all change,' sighed Chanteau between a
couple of groans, as he lay back in his arm-chair, where he
was just recovering from another attack of gout. 'But you
yourself, my dear, you know you are a little given to
restlessness.'</p>

<p>His wife shrugged her shoulders as though to imply that
all her actions were dictated and carried out by reason and
common-sense. Then she added slowly: 'Well, what are
we to say? I suppose we shall have to write to him and tell
him that he may have his own way. I wanted to see him in
the magistracy, and I wasn't over well pleased at his being a
doctor; but now he has got down to being an apothecary!
Still, if he comes back home again and makes a lot of money,
that will be better than nothing.'</p>

<p>It was really this hope of money-making which decided
her. She began to indulge in new dreams for the son she
was so fond of. She foresaw him very wealthy, the owner of
a fine house at Caen, a councillor-general, perhaps even a
deputy. Chanteau, who had no opinion either one way or
the other, and was absorbed in his own sufferings, left his wife
to see after all the interests of the family. Pauline, in spite of
her surprise and silent disapprobation of her cousin's continual
changes, thought that he had better be allowed to try his luck
at the grand new scheme which he had got into his head.</p>

<p>'At any rate, we shall be all together,' she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>'And it's precious little good that Monsieur Lazare seems
to be doing in Paris,' Véronique ventured to add. 'It will be
better for him to come and live quietly here with us.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau nodded assent. She again took up
the letter which she had received that morning.</p>

<p>'He here goes into the financial side of his scheme,'
she said. Then she read the letter, commenting on it as she
proceeded. Sixty thousand francs would be required for erecting
the works. In Paris Lazare had met one of his old Caen
friends, Boutigny, who was now selling wine on commission
there. Boutigny was very enthusiastic about the new scheme,
and had offered to invest thirty thousand francs in the business.
He would make an admirable partner, one whose practical
business habits would ensure the success of the undertaking.
There would, however, still remain thirty thousand francs to
be borrowed somewhere, as Lazare was anxious to have half
the business in his own hands.</p>

<p>'As you hear,' continued Madame Chanteau, 'he wants
me to apply in his name to Thibaudier. It is a good idea,
and I am sure Thibaudier will let him have the money.
Louise is not very well just now, and I have thought of
going to Caen to ask her to stay with us for a week. As I
shall see her father, I will mention the matter to him.'</p>

<p>A cloud passed before Pauline's eyes, and her lips quivered
as she drew them tightly together. Véronique was standing
at the other side of the table, wiping a tea-cup and watching
her closely.</p>

<p>'I had, indeed, thought of another way,' said Madame
Chanteau in a low voice; 'but as there is always some risk in
a business enterprise, I have come to the conclusion to say
nothing about it.'</p>

<p>Then, turning to the young girl, she added: 'Yes, my
dear, you might have lent the thirty thousand francs to your
cousin yourself. You couldn't find a better investment, and
you would very likely get twenty-five per cent. interest, for
your cousin would share his profits with you, and it quite
grieves me to think of a lot of money going into an outsider's
pocket. But I shouldn't like you to run any risk with your
fortune. It is a sacred deposit. It is quite safe upstairs, and
I will restore it to you unimpaired.'</p>

<p>Pauline grew pale as she listened to her aunt's words; and
a struggle went on within her. She had inherited a somewhat
avaricious disposition: Quenu's and Lisa's love of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
money. In the pork-butcher's shop she had been taught to
reverence its power, and to guard against the want of it.
Then, too, her aunt had so frequently called her attention to
the drawer in the secrétaire where her little fortune was
locked up, that the thought of seeing it gradually squandered
by her erratic cousin irritated her. So she kept silent,
though she was also troubled by a vision of Louise handing a
great bag of money to Lazare.</p>

<p>'Even if you, my dear, should wish it, I shouldn't,'
Madame Chanteau continued; and, addressing her husband,
she added: 'It is quite a matter of conscience, isn't it?'</p>

<p>'Her money belongs to her,' said Chanteau with a deep
groan as he tried to move his leg. 'If things were to turn
out badly, we should be called upon to make good the loss.
No! no! we mustn't do that. Thibaudier will be glad to
lend it, I have no doubt.'</p>

<p>Then Pauline, in an impulse of affection, cried:</p>

<p>'No! no! please don't grieve me like this. I certainly
ought to lend the money to Lazare myself. Isn't he my
brother? It would be very unkind of me if I refused to let
him have it. How could you suppose that I could have any
objection? Give him the money at once, aunt; give him
all of it!'</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears at the effort she had just made;
then her face broke out into a smile, while she remained in
a state of confusion between her regret at having hesitated
for a moment and a miserable fear that the money would
be lost. She had to struggle a little while against the
protest of her relations, who were certainly honest enough
to show her the risks she would run.</p>

<p>'Come and kiss me then, my dear,' her aunt finished by
saying, yielding to the girl's tears. 'You are a very good
girl, and you shall lend Lazare your money, since it would
vex you so much if he did not take it.'</p>

<p>'Come and kiss me, too, dear, won't you?' added her
uncle. They cried and kissed all round the table. Then, as
Pauline went out of the room to call Matthew, and Véronique
brought in the tea, Madame Chanteau exclaimed, wiping the
tears from her eyes: 'It's a great consolation to find her
generous-minded.'</p>

<p>'Of course!' growled the servant; 'why, she would strip
her chemise off her back rather than let that other one have
a chance of giving anything!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a week later, on a Saturday, that Lazare returned
to Bonneville. Doctor Cazenove, who had been invited to
dine with the Chanteaus, brought the young man along with
him in his gig. They found Abbé Horteur, who was also
dining there that evening, playing draughts with Chanteau,
who was lying back in his invalid's chair. He had been
suffering for three months past from the attack from which
he was now recovering. It had been more painful and violent
than any previous one, and now, in spite of the terrible
twinges he constantly felt in his feet, he considered himself in
a state of Paradise. His skin was scaling, and the swellings
had almost disappeared. Véronique was busy roasting some
pigeons in the kitchen, and every time the door opened he
sniffed the appetizing odour, overcome, again, by his irrepressible
greediness, on which subject the priest began to
remonstrate with him.</p>

<p>'You are not attending to the game, Monsieur Chanteau.
Now, be advised by me, and be very careful about what you
eat this evening. Rich food is bad for you in your present
condition.'</p>

<p>Louise had arrived the previous day. When she and
Pauline heard the Doctor's gig approaching, they both rushed
wildly into the yard. But it was only his cousin whom
Lazare appeared to notice, and he looked at her with an
expression of amazement.</p>

<p>'What! can this really be Pauline?'</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, it is I.'</p>

<p>'But, good gracious, what a lot you must have eaten to
have grown like that! Why, you are quite big enough to
get married now!'</p>

<p>She blushed, and laughed gaily, her eyes glistening with
pleasure at seeing him take such notice of her. He had left
her a mere chit, a raw schoolgirl in a pinafore, and now he
saw her again as a well-grown young woman, whose figure
showed to advantage in her white rose-sprayed summer gown.
However, she became quite serious as she examined him in
turn. She thought he was looking much older, he stooped,
his laugh no longer sounded young, and his face twitched
nervously at times.</p>

<p>'By the way,' said Lazare, 'I must really treat you a
little more ceremoniously now. How do you do, partner?'</p>

<p>Pauline's blush assumed a deeper tint; the word 'partner'
made her feel intensely happy. When her cousin had kissed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
her, he might well kiss Louise afterwards. She experienced
no feeling of jealousy now.</p>

<p>It was a delightful dinner. Chanteau, alarmed by the
Doctor's threats, ate with moderation. Madame Chanteau
and the priest discussed magnificent schemes for the aggrandizement
of Bonneville when the sea-weed business
should have enriched the neighbourhood. It was eleven
o'clock before they separated. As Lazare and Pauline were
about to quit each other, at the doors of their rooms, the
young man said to her laughingly:</p>

<p>'So young ladies, when they have grown up, no longer
wish one good-night?'</p>

<p>'Why, yes, they do,' she cried; and, throwing her arms
round his neck, she kissed him full on the lips with all her
old girlish impulsiveness.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="III" id="III">III</a></h3>


<p>Two days later a very low tide laid the rocks quite bare.
Lazare, brimming over with the wild enthusiasm which
always filled him at the outset of any of his new schemes, was
impatient to be off to the sea-weed. So away he hurried,
with bare legs and just a canvas jacket over his bathing-costume.
Pauline went with him to share in his investigations.
She, too, wore a bathing-costume and the heavy
shoes which she used when bound on shrimping expeditions.
When they had got about half a mile from the cliffs, and had
reached the centre of the spreading tract of sea-weed, still
streaming with the water of the ebbing tide, the young man's
enthusiasm burst forth as if he were only now discovering
that immense crop of marine plants over which he and
Pauline had rambled a hundred times before.</p>

<p>'Look! look!' he cried; 'what money we shall make
out of it all; and nobody has ever thought of making any use
of it before!'</p>

<p>Then he began to point out to her the different species
with gleeful pedantry; the zosterias, of a delicate green and
similar to long hair, stretching far away in spreading
lawns; the ulvæ, with large lettuce-like leaves of glaucous
transparency; the serrated fuci and the bladder-bearing fuci,
which grew in such thick profusion that they enveloped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
rocks like thick moss. As they followed the tide, too,
they came upon species of greater size and stranger forms,
such as various kinds of laminaria, especially that known as
Neptune's Belt, a girdle-like strip of greenish leather, with
wrinkled edges, that looked as though it were made to circle
some giant's waist.</p>

<p>'What wealth there is going to waste here!' exclaimed
Lazare. 'How stupid people are! In Scotland folks are
sensible enough to make some use of the ulvæ at any rate, for
they turn it into food and eat it. We here just use the fuci
to pack fish with, and the zosteria to stuff mattresses; and as
for the rest, it is simply turned into manure; and all that
science does is to burn a few cartloads to extract soda from
the residue.'</p>

<p>Pauline, in the water to her knees, felt perfectly happy
amidst all the sharp saltness; and her cousin's explanations
interested her extremely.</p>

<p>'So do you intend to distil all this?' she asked.</p>

<p>Lazare was very much amused with the word 'distil.'</p>

<p>'Yes; distil it, if you like to call it so. But the process
is a very complicated one, as you'll see. However, mark my
words. We have subjugated terrestrial vegetation to our
use; we eat vegetables and fruit, and avail ourselves in other
ways of trees and plants, don't we? Well, perhaps we shall
find that we can turn marine vegetation to still greater
profit when we seriously try to do so.'</p>

<p>Meantime they both enthusiastically gathered specimens,
loading themselves and going so far out that they became
drenched on their way back. Lazare went on pouring
forth explanations, repeating all that his master, Herbelin,
had told him. The ocean was a vast reservoir of chemical
compounds, and the sea-weed was ever condensing in its
tissues the salts contained in the water. The problem they
had to solve was how to extract from the sea-weed all its
useful components at small cost. He talked of taking the
ashes which resulted from combustion&mdash;the impure soda of
commerce&mdash;of sifting them, and finally extracting in a state
of perfect purity the various iodides and bromides of sodium
and potassium, the sulphate of soda, and the various salts of
iron and manganese, so as to turn every particle of the
material to profitable use. He waxed particularly enthusiastic
over the fact that by the system which the illustrious
Herbelin had devised nothing that could be of the slightest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
use would be lost. So there was an immense fortune before
them.</p>

<p>'Good gracious! what a mess you're in!' cried Madame
Chanteau, when they got home again.</p>

<p>'Never mind about that,' said Lazare gaily, as he flung
his load of sea-weed on to the middle of the terrace. 'We
are bringing you back five-franc pieces.'</p>

<p>The next day one of the Verchemont peasants was sent
with a cart to bring back a whole load of weed, and the
experiments were commenced in the big room on the second
floor. Pauline was appointed assistant. For a month they
went quite mad over the subject. The room was soon
crammed with dried weeds, with jars containing floating
sprays, and instruments of all sorts of odd shapes. There
was a microscope on the table, and the piano was hidden
beneath retorts and flasks; whilst the wardrobe groaned with
the weight of technical works and collections that were
perpetually being referred to. The experiments, made with
small quantities of material with the most scrupulous care,
gave encouraging results. Herbelin's cold system was based
upon the discovery that certain bodies crystallise at very low
temperatures, and the only thing required was to obtain the
necessary lowness of temperature, whereupon each particular
substance deposited itself in crystals successively, and thus
separate from others. Lazare burned the weeds in a pit, mixed
the ashes with water, and subjected them to the necessary
temperature, which he obtained by a refrigerative method
based upon the rapid evaporation of ammonia. He would
afterwards have to carry out these operations on a large
scale and transfer them from the laboratory to proper works,
observing careful economy in the method of manufacture and
the installation of the requisite plant.</p>

<p>On the day when he succeeded in extracting five distinct
substances from his crude liquor, the room rang with cries
of triumph. They had obtained quite a surprising proportion
of bromide of potassium, and would be able to supply that
popular remedy as plentifully as bread. Pauline danced
wildly round the table; and then flew downstairs and burst
into the dining-room, where her uncle was reading his newspaper
and her aunt was marking table-napkins.</p>

<p>'There!' she cried, 'you can be as ill as you like now,
and we can give you as much bromide of potassium as ever
you'll want!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>Madame Chanteau, who had been suffering lately from
nervous attacks, had been put upon a bromide <i>régime</i> by
Doctor Cazenove. She smiled as she answered:</p>

<p>'Have you got enough to cure everyone?&mdash;for everyone
seems to be out of sorts just now.'</p>

<p>The vigorous young girl, whose face beamed with robust
health, spread out her arms as though she were casting the
remedy to the four corners of the earth.</p>

<p>'Yes, yes!' said she, 'we shall make enough for the
whole world. Neurosis is done for!'</p>

<p>After inspecting the coast Lazare decided that he would
build his works near the Golden Bay. It answered all the
necessary requirements. It had a wide spreading beach,
flagged as it were with flat rocks, which facilitated the gathering
of the weed; there was good communication from it
by the Verchemont Road; land was cheap; the necessary
materials were at hand; and it was sufficiently isolated
without being remote. Pauline joked about the name which
they had given to the bay on account of its gleaming sand.
They did not think then, said she, that they would ever find
real gold there, as they were going to do now. They made a
capital beginning, bought about five acres of barren land at
a low price, and obtained the Prefect's authorisation after
only two months' delay. Then the building was commenced.
Boutigny had already arrived on the scene. He was a little,
ruddy-faced man of thirty, extremely common in appearance,
and the Chanteaus did not take to him at all. He declined
to live at Bonneville, saying that he had found a very convenient
house at Verchemont; and the family's coldness
towards him increased when they heard that he had brought
there a woman whom he had probably picked up in some low
haunt in Paris. Lazare shrugged his shoulders at what he
called their provincial narrow-mindedness. She was a very
pleasant sort of person, he thought, and had shown a good
deal of devotion in consenting to bury herself in such a
wilderness; but he made no further protest, on Pauline's
account. What was expected from Boutigny was active
surveillance and intelligent organisation of the work, and in
this respect he showed himself to be all that could be desired.
He was never idle, and had a perfect genius for management;
under his direction the building soon sprang up.</p>

<p>For the next four months, while the work for the installation
of the machinery was going on, the Golden Bay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Factory, as they called it, became the goal of the young people's
daily walk. Madame Chanteau sometimes went with them,
but Matthew was more often their only companion. He
soon grew tired, dragged his big feet along wearily till they
reached the works, when he would lie down, with his tongue
hanging out, panting like a blacksmith's bellows. The dog
was the only one of the party who bathed now, and would
rush into the sea whenever a stick was thrown for him to
fetch, showing sufficient intelligence to turn his back to the
waves when he seized the stick, so as to avoid swallowing
the salt water. At each visit to the works Lazare used to
hurry on the contractors, while Pauline made practical
remarks which occasionally showed a good deal of common-sense.</p>

<p>The apparatus, constructed after designs made by Lazare
himself, had been ordered at Caen, and workmen came thence
to set it up. Boutigny was beginning to show a good deal of
uneasiness at the rapid rate at which the estimates increased.
Why couldn't they have commenced with as small a building
as possible, and with merely the absolutely indispensable
appliances, he asked. Why launch out into all those
intricate workshops and rooms and all that elaborate
machinery for a business which it would have been more
prudent to have started on a small scale? They might gradually
have extended it as they gained some experience of
the conditions under which it ought to be carried on and the
demand there might be for the output. But Lazare was
carried away by his enthusiastic dreams, and, if he had been
allowed to have his own way entirely, he would have added
to the works a magnificent façade looking towards the sea
and proclaiming the grandeur of his plans to the limitless
horizon. Each visit only seemed to increase his feverish
hopes. So, what was the use of being stingy, especially as
they were going to make such a fortune out of the place?
Thus the walk back was delightfully gay. Poor Matthew
used to lag far behind them; and at times Pauline and Lazare
would hide behind a wall, as delighted as little children
when the dog, suddenly finding himself alone and fearing
that he was lost, began hunting about for them in a state of
comical alarm.</p>

<p>Every evening on their return they were greeted with the
same question: 'Well, how's it all getting on? Are you well
pleased?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>The answer, too, was always the same.</p>

<p>'Oh, yes; but it is not finished yet.'</p>

<p>This was a period of close intimacy between the two
young people. Lazare showed a warm affection for Pauline,
which a feeling of gratitude for the money she had advanced
served to strengthen. Again, too, he gradually lost sight of
her sex and regarded her as a boyish companion, a younger
brother, whose good points became more manifest every day.
She was so sensible and courageous, so cheerful and pleasant,
that he could not refrain from looking on her with an unconfessed
feeling of respect and esteem, which he tried to conceal
even from himself by chaffing and teasing her. In the most
unconcerned and casual way she had told him of her private
studies and her aunt's horror, and he had experienced a moment's
wonder and embarrassment as the girl, who knew so
much already, turned her big candid eyes upon him. After
that, however, a perfect understanding seemed to exist between
them, and he talked freely and openly, as they worked together
at their common studies. She was continually asking him
questions, in which she appeared to have no other object than
the simple acquisition of information, so that she might
make herself useful to him. And she often amused him by
the many gaps which she showed in her knowledge, by the
extraordinary mixture of information with which she was
crammed. When she showed herself to be labouring under
some ludicrous misconception, Lazare broke out into such
peals of laughter that she grew quite angry with him and told
him that it would be much better if, instead of laughing at
her, he would show her where she was wrong; and the matter
generally terminated in a lesson.</p>

<p>Pauline, however, was changing; she often felt a vague
uneasiness. At times, when Lazare pulled her about in his
brotherly fashion, her heart would beat excitedly. The woman
whom they had forgotten all about was awaking within her
amid the pulsing of her blood. She often believed that she
was on the point of falling into some serious illness, for she
grew very feverish, and could not sleep. In the daytime,
too, she felt weary and listless, but she made no complaints
to her aunt.</p>

<p>One evening, after dinner, however, she began to talk
about the absurdity and annoyance of dreams. How tiresome
it was that one was compelled to lie on one's back, quite
defenceless and helpless, a prey to all sorts of idiotic ideas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
and fancies! But what vexed her most, she said, was the
absolute loss and annihilation both of the will and body power.
Then her cousin, with his pessimistic views, also fell foul
of dreams, as disturbing the happiness and serenity of utter
unconsciousness. Her uncle, however, proceeded to distinguish
between different sorts of dreams, saying that he
liked to have pleasant ones, while he detested nightmares.
Pauline spoke so strongly on the subject that Madame
Chanteau, in surprise, began to question her. Then she
stammered and hesitated, saying that her dreams were about
all sorts of ridiculous things, trifles too vague to remember.
And she was speaking the truth in this respect, for the
incidents of her dreams remained obscure. She saw no one
in them; and all she felt was like the kiss of the sea-breezes
as they flew at her window in the summer-time.</p>

<p>Every day Pauline's affection for Lazare seemed to
increase. And this was not merely the instinctive awakening
of womanhood after seven years' brotherly companionship;
she also felt a need of devoting herself to somebody, and
illusion showed him to her as the worthiest in intelligence
and strength of all she knew. By slow degrees her old
sisterly feeling was being transformed into love, with sweet
touches of budding passion, secret thrills, furtive longings,
all the fond delights that attend the heart's start upon its
journey of affection, beneath the promptings of Nature.
Lazare, protected by his former free-and-easy life in the
students' quarter of Paris, had no curiosity to satisfy, and
still looked upon her as a sister, never as an object of desire;
while she, on the other hand, all virginal purity in this lonely
spot where she knew no other young man, grew to worship
him more and more, and to bestow herself upon him entirely.
From morning till evening, when they were together, she
seemed to derive life from his presence, and her eyes ever
sought his, as she eagerly busied herself to serve him.</p>

<p>About this time Madame Chanteau became quite astonished
at Pauline's piety. She saw her go twice to confession.
Then all at once she seemed to take a dislike to Abbé Horteur,
and for three Sundays even refused to go to mass, only
resuming her attendance at the church subsequently in order
that she might not displease her aunt. She gave no explanation
of her conduct; but she had probably been offended and
displeased by something the Abbé had said to her, for he was
not a man of refined speech. It was at this period that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
Madame Chanteau, with her keen maternal instinct, discovered
Pauline's growing love for Lazare; but she said nothing
about it to anyone, not even to her husband. The knowledge
of it came upon her as a surprise, for until now affection and
possible marriage between the young people had not entered
into her plans or thoughts. Like Lazare, she had gone on
regarding her ward as a mere schoolgirl. Now, she told
herself, it was her duty to look sharply after them; but she
did not do so, really feeling very little interest or anxiety about
a love which her son did not appear to return.</p>

<p>When the hot days of August came round, Lazare suggested
one evening that they should have a bathe next
day, on their way to the works. Madame Chanteau accompanied
them on this occasion, in spite of the terrible heat.
She sat down on the burning shingle, with Matthew by her
side, sheltering herself beneath her sunshade, under which
the dog tried to stretch his head.</p>

<p>'Hallo! where's she off to?' all at once cried Lazare, as
he saw Pauline disappear behind a rock.</p>

<p>'She is going to get ready, of course!' said Madame
Chanteau. 'Turn your head away. It isn't decorous; and
she won't like it.'</p>

<p>He seemed quite astonished, then looked at his mother,
and turned his back to the rock. Finally, he also began to
undress, without saying a word.</p>

<p>'Are you ready?' he shouted, at last. 'What a time you
are!'</p>

<p>Pauline ran lightly towards him, with a laugh which
sounded a little forced. They had never bathed together
since Lazare's return home. She wore a swimming-costume,
made in a single piece and fastened about her waist by a belt.
With her lissom figure she looked like a Florentine statue.
Her arms and legs were bare, and her small feet, white as a
child's, were shod with sandals.</p>

<p>'Well,' said Lazare, 'shall we go as far as the Picochets?'</p>

<p>'Yes, to the Picochets,' she answered.</p>

<p>'Don't go far!' cried Madame Chanteau. 'I shall feel
so frightened if you do.'</p>

<p>But they were already in the water. The Picochets were
a group of rocks which the high tide did not quite cover, and
lay about half a mile off. The young people swam along
leisurely, side by side, like a pair of friends out for a walk on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
some smooth straight road. Matthew followed them for a
little way, but, when he saw them still going forward without
sign of returning, he swam back to the shore and shook the
water out of his coat, splashing the drops all over Madame
Chanteau. Unnecessary exertion of this kind did not commend
itself to his lazy nature.</p>

<p>'You are a sensible animal,' said the old lady. 'It is
quite wicked of them to go risking their lives in this way.'</p>

<p>She could only just discern the heads of Pauline and
Lazare bobbing up in the water like tufts of sea-weed moving
with the waves. There was a pleasant swell, and they
skimmed along with a gentle undulatory motion, talking
quietly and examining the sea-weed that floated past them
in the transparent water. Then Pauline, beginning to feel
a little tired, turned herself upon her back and floated,
gazing the while at the sky, like one lost amidst the blue
immensity. She still retained all her old love for the sea
that was now so softly cradling her. She loved its sharp
fresh breath and its pure cold waves; and she yielded to it
entirely, happy in its ceaseless rippling against her flesh,
and revelling in the exertion of swimming, which kept
down the throbbing of her heart. Suddenly, however, she
gave a slight cry. Her cousin glanced towards her uneasily,
and asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>'I'm afraid,' she said, 'that the bodice of my costume has
split. I swung my left arm out too quickly.'</p>

<p>Then they both laughed. Pauline had begun to swim
leisurely again, and was smiling a little uneasily as she
contemplated the accident to her costume. A shoulder-strap
had given way. Her cousin merrily told her to feel in her
pocket, to see if she had not some pins about her. Soon
afterwards, however, they reached the Picochets, whereupon
Lazare mounted on a ledge of rock, as it was the custom to
rest and draw breath before returning to the shore. But
Pauline remained in the water and continued swimming
round the rocks.</p>

<p>'Aren't you coming up?'</p>

<p>'No. I'd rather stay where I am.'</p>

<p>Lazare thought it was a mere whim of hers, and felt
vexed with her. It was very foolish, he remarked. If she
didn't come out of the water and rest a little, she would
break down on the journey back. But she persisted in staying
where she was, and did not even answer her cousin, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
with the water up to her chin, she still swam on gently,
seeking to hide the snowy whiteness of her naked shoulder,
which shone, vague and milky, like the pearliness of a
shell. Towards the open sea the rocks were hollowed out
into a kind of grotto, where they had often played at being
Robinson Crusoes. Far away on the other side Madame
Chanteau, sitting on the beach, looked like a black insect.</p>

<p>'Take your own course, then, you foolish, obstinate girl!'
cried Lazare, springing into the water again. 'I sha'n't help
you, remember that.'</p>

<p>Then they slowly started on their return to the shore.
They sulked with each other and would not speak. When
Lazare heard Pauline beginning to pant, he told her that
she had better turn upon her back again and float, but she
did not appear to hear him. The rent in her costume was
widening. At the slightest attempt to turn, her breast would
have burst clear out of the water. Lazare, at last, apparently
began to understand things, and, seeing how tired she was,
and fearing that she would never be able to reach the shore
without assistance swam close to her, resolutely determined
upon bearing her up. She tried to escape him,
however, and to continue swimming by herself. But at last
she was obliged to yield to him; and when they reached the
shore again, Lazare was holding her in a close embrace.</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau had rushed down to the edge of the
water in a terrible state of alarm, while Matthew stood in
the sea up to his stomach, barking loudly.</p>

<p>'How wicked and foolish of you! I told you that you
were going too far!'</p>

<p>Pauline had fainted. Lazare carried her on to the sand
as though she were a child. And all at once she heaved a
deep sigh and opened her eyes. As soon as she recognised
her cousin, she burst out sobbing and nearly choked him with
her hysterical embrace, as she kissed him full on the lips.
She hardly knew what she was doing; she was acting
under the influence of a sudden impulse of love, which the
consciousness of her escape from death had sent thrilling
through her.</p>

<p>'Oh! how good you are, Lazare! Oh! how I love you!'</p>

<p>He shook, almost unbalanced by the impetuosity of his
cousin's kiss. While Madame Chanteau was dressing her,
he went off of his own accord. The walk back to Bonneville
was slow and painful, as both the young people were thoroughly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
worn out with fatigue. Madame Chanteau walked between
them, thinking that the time had come for decisive action.</p>

<p>There were other causes for uneasiness in the family.
The works at Golden Bay were now finished, and for the last
week they had been testing the apparatus, with the most
deplorable results. Lazare was obliged to confess that he
had made some serious mistakes in several portions of it.
He thereupon set off to Paris to consult his master, Herbelin,
and came back in a very discouraged frame of mind. Everything
would have to be made over again. The celebrated
chemist had introduced great improvements into his method,
which necessitated many alterations in the appliances. But
then the sixty thousand francs were entirely spent, and
Boutigny absolutely refused to advance another sou. From
morning till night he talked sarcastically and bitterly of the
foolish squandering of money over fads, with the pertinacity
of a practical man whose warning has turned out correct.
Lazare felt inclined to murder him. But what troubled him
more than anything else was the thought of Pauline's thirty
thousand francs lying lost in that abyss of disaster. His
honour and pride revolted against the idea. It was impossible
to think of it. More money must be got somewhere. They
could not abandon an undertaking which would surely bring
them millions eventually.</p>

<p>'Don't make yourself unhappy about it,' said his mother,
as she saw him becoming quite ill with the worry of obtaining
more capital. 'We haven't got so low yet as not to be able
to raise a few thousand-franc notes.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau was working out a plan of her own.
The idea of a marriage between Pauline and Lazare struck her
as being very feasible and desirable. There was only some nine
years' difference between their ages, and that was a thing one
saw every day. A marriage, too, would be such a convenient
way of settling matters. Lazare would be working for his
wife, and need not trouble himself any further about the debt;
moreover, he would be able to take from Pauline's fortune
whatever further sums he wanted. At the bottom of her
heart, it is true, Madame Chanteau felt some trifling scruples
about the course she meditated, having a lurking fear of the
possibility of an utter catastrophe, and the complete ruin of
her ward. But she pooh-poohed the idea of such an ending
to the great scheme. Wasn't it beyond doubt that Lazare
was a very clever fellow who knew perfectly well what he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
was doing? He would make Pauline very wealthy one of
these days, and it was really she who would benefit by the
marriage. It mattered nothing that Lazare was without
fortune at present. He was a fortune in himself.</p>

<p>The marriage was quickly agreed upon. One morning
Madame Chanteau went into Pauline's room and sounded the
young girl, who, with smiling tranquillity, confessed her love
for her cousin. Then her aunt told her she must pretend
to be tired, and in the afternoon went alone with her son
to the works. As they came back she unfolded to him her
scheme, telling him of his cousin's affection for him, the convenience
and suitability of the proposed marriage, and the
advantages to be derived from it. At first he was quite
amazed. He had never entertained such a notion. The girl
was quite a child, wasn't she? Then he became moved,
and finally told his mother that he certainly liked Pauline very
much, and would do all she wished.</p>

<p>As they came back into the house they found Pauline
laying the table, for want of something else to do. Her
uncle, with his newspaper laying on his knee, was watching
Minouche, who was fastidiously licking her fur.</p>

<p>'Well, so there's a probability of a wedding, I hear,' said
Lazare, concealing his emotion beneath an affectation of
gaiety.</p>

<p>Pauline stood quite still, holding a plate in her hands, and
blushed deeply, unable to say a word.</p>

<p>'Who is going to be married?' asked her uncle, suddenly,
as though he had just awoke.</p>

<p>His wife had told him all about it in the morning, but the
dainty way in which the cat was licking herself had absorbed
his attention. However, he quickly remembered.</p>

<p>'Ah! yes, of course!' said he.</p>

<p>Then he looked at the young people mischievously, while a
sudden painful twinge in his right foot made his lips twitch.
Pauline had gently put the plate down, and, turning to
Lazare, she said:</p>

<p>'If you are willing, I'm quite willing too.'</p>

<p>'There! that's settled, then. Give each other a kiss,'
exclaimed Madame Chanteau, hanging up her straw hat.</p>

<p>The girl went up to Lazare, holding out her hands to him.
He, laughing, took them within his own, and began to joke.</p>

<p>'You have deserted your doll, then? And this is why
you hide yourself away so that one may not even see you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
washing your finger-tips! And it is poor Lazare that you
have selected for your victim!'</p>

<p>'Oh! aunt, do make him give over, or I shall go away!'
murmured Pauline, looking painfully confused and trying to
make her escape.</p>

<p>Little by little he drew her closer to him, playing with
her as in the old days of their boy-like chumship. Then she
suddenly planted a smacking kiss on his cheek, which he
returned chancewise on her ear. But some secret thought
seemed to cast a gloom over him, and he said sadly:</p>

<p>'It's a sorry bargain you are making, my poor child. You
don't know what a very old man I am. Still, if you really
wish it&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>The dinner was wildly gay. They all talked at once, and
made all kinds of plans for the future, as though they were
now meeting for the first time. Véronique, who had just
come into the room as the engagement was being announced,
went back into the kitchen and banged the door after her
without saying a single word. When the dessert was laid
upon the table, their noisy gaiety toned down a little and
they began to talk about matters more seriously. Madame
Chanteau said that the marriage could not take place for
another two years, for she should prefer them to wait till
Pauline was fully of age, so that there might be no risk of
any suspicion that any advantage had been taken of her
youth. Pauline looked aghast at this announcement of two
years' delay, but her aunt's sense of honour touched her
deeply, and she got up from her chair to go and kiss her. A
date for the wedding was fixed; the two young people would
have to learn to be patient, and meanwhile they would also
be earning the first portion of their future millions. No
doubt at all was felt as to their ultimate great wealth.</p>

<p>'Pull out the drawer, aunt dear,' said Pauline, 'and give
him as much money as ever he wants. It is as much his
as mine now.'</p>

<p>But Madame Chanteau would not hear of this.</p>

<p>'No, indeed. Not a single sou of it shall be spent unnecessarily.
You know you can fully trust me for that, and I
would rather have my right hand cut off than that you should
be a loser. You want ten thousand francs for the works?
Well, those ten thousand francs I will give you, and the rest
I will keep tightly locked up. Not a sou of it shall be touched.'</p>

<p>'With ten thousand francs,' said Lazare, 'I am quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
certain of success. All the heavy expenses are already paid,
and it would really be wicked not to go on with it now. You
will see presently. And you, my dear, I will have you dressed
in a robe of cloth-of-gold like a queen on our wedding-day.'</p>

<p>Their happiness and gaiety were increased by the unexpected
arrival of Doctor Cazenove. He had just been
attending to the injuries of a fisherman, who had crushed his
fingers underneath a boat, and the family insisted upon his
remaining with them and having some tea. The great news
did not appear to surprise him; but, as he heard the Chanteaus
launching out enthusiastically in praise of the sea-weed
scheme, he glanced uneasily at Pauline, and said:</p>

<p>'Yes, no doubt the idea is ingenious and worth a trial.
But a safe investment in stock is better. If I were you, I
should prefer being happy at once in a quiet sort of way&mdash;'</p>

<p>He stopped short on seeing a shadow pass over the young
girl's face, and the warm affection which he felt for her induced
him to speak against his own convictions.</p>

<p>'But money is very pleasant to have; so, perhaps, you
had better make a lot of it. And I will certainly come and
dance at the wedding. I will dance the Zambuco of the
Caribbeans, a dance I don't suppose you ever heard of. You
stretch out your arms like the sails of a windmill, and then
keep striking your thighs as you dance round a captive,
while he is being cut up and cooked by the women.'</p>

<p>The months flew past. Pauline regained all her old
placid cheerfulness. Doubt and uncertainty were the only
things that could seriously trouble her candid and frank
nature. The confession of her love and the fixing of a date
for her marriage with Lazare seemed to have put an end
to the disturbing feelings that had assailed her. Her engagement
caused little difference in her relations with Lazare;
they both led their old life of familiar companionship; he
ever busily engaged in the advancement of his great scheme,
and quite protected from sudden passion by his former
adventures in Paris, and she so simple and pure-minded in
her virginity and knowledge that she was shielded as by a
double wall of protection.</p>

<p>Sometimes, indeed, they would take each other by the
hand, in that big disorderly room, and lovingly smile at one
another; and while they read together some treatise on Marine
Botany their heads would perhaps rest tenderly against each
other; or, as they examined some flask brown with bromine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
or some purple specimen of iodine, Pauline would lean gently
against Lazare, or bend down over the instruments that
littered the table and piano and bring her face near to his, or
ask him to lift her up so that she might reach the topmost
shelf of the cupboard. But at those moments there was
nothing beyond decorous permissible tenderness, such as
might have been manifested openly before the members of
their family. Madame Chanteau herself said that they
behaved in an extremely proper and sensible manner; and
when Louise arrived, with all her pretty airs and graces,
Pauline did not exhibit the slightest jealousy.</p>

<p>A whole year passed away in this fashion. The works
were now in operation, and the worries which arose kept
Pauline and Lazare from thinking about anything else. The
new appliances had been set up after considerable difficulty,
and the first results seemed excellent. Certainly the yield
was slight, but when the system should be brought to
greater perfection, and all care and energy should be shown,
there was no doubt that they would quickly reach an enormous
output. Boutigny had already found great openings
for their products; more than they could supply, indeed.
Success and fortune seemed ensured, and this apparent
certainty carried them off their heads. From their former
despondency they now rushed to the other extreme, casting
money by handfuls into extensions and alterations of the
works, and never feeling the least doubt that they would find
it all again, melted into a huge golden ingot. Every fresh
outlay seemed only to urge them on to another.</p>

<p>On the first few occasions Madame Chanteau refused to
take any money from the drawer without notifying Pauline.</p>

<p>'There are some payments to be made on Saturday, my
dear,' she would say. 'Will you come with me upstairs, and
settle what scrip we shall sell?'</p>

<p>'Oh! there's no occasion for that, aunt,' Pauline would
reply. 'You can settle that yourself.'</p>

<p>'No, my dear, you know that I never do anything without
consulting you. It is your money.'</p>

<p>In time, however, Madame Chanteau grew less rigid in
this respect. One evening Lazare told her of a debt which
he had concealed from Pauline, five thousand francs spent
on copper pipes which had not even been used. She had only
just returned from a visit to the drawer with her niece, so she
went upstairs again by herself, on seeing the despair her son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
was in, and took out the extra five thousand francs, on a
solemn promise that he would repay them out of the first profits.</p>

<p>But from that day her old strictness departed, and she
began to take scrip out of the drawer without consulting
Pauline. She found it a little unpleasant and humiliating,
too, at her age, to be continually consulting a mere child,
and she rebelled against doing so. The money would all be
paid back to Pauline; and, even if it did belong to her, that
was no reason why one should never be able to make the
slightest move without obtaining her permission. So from
this time she ceased to insist on Pauline accompanying her
on her visits to the secrétaire. Pauline was really happier
in consequence, for, in spite of her kind and generous heart,
those constant withdrawals of money perturbed her. Her
common-sense began to warn her of the probability of a
catastrophe, and the feelings of prudence and economy which
she had inherited from her mother were now roused in
opposition to all the reckless expenditure. At first she was
surprised at Madame Chanteau's silence, for she felt sure
that the money was going the same way as before, with the
one difference that she was not being consulted about it.
After a little time, however, she felt that she preferred it to
be so. It, at any rate, saved her the grief of seeing the
bundle of papers grow smaller at each visit to the drawer.
Between herself and her aunt there was but a quick exchange
of glances at certain times; a steady anxious gaze on the
girl's part, when she guessed some further abstraction, and
a vacillating look from Madame Chanteau, who felt irritated
that she should be obliged to turn away her head. Thus
bitterness and dislike began to arise between them.</p>

<p>That year, unfortunately, Davoine became a bankrupt.
Though the disaster had been foreseen, it was none the less a
terrible blow for the Chanteaus. They still had their three
thousand francs a year arising from their investments in
stock; and all that they were able to save from the wreck
of the timber business, some twelve thousand francs, was
at once invested, so as to bring their total income up to
three hundred francs a month. In the second fortnight
Madame Chanteau was driven to take fifty francs of Pauline's
money. The butcher from Verchemont was waiting with his
bill, and she could not send him away without paying him.
Then there were fifty francs wanted to pay for a washing-machine,
and ten more for potatoes, and even fifty sous for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
fish. She came to the point of supplying the needs of
Lazare and the works in wretched little sums, which she
doled out day by day. Towards the end of each month she
was often to be seen stealthily disappearing and then
coming back again with her hand in her pocket, from which she
reluctantly drew forth sou after sou, to make up the amount
of a bill. The habit quickly grew upon her, and she soon
depended entirely upon the contents of the drawer, helping
herself to the money, whenever occasion required, without
any hesitation. When she opened the lid of the secrétaire,
however, that old piece of furniture would give a slight
creak which used to affect her unpleasantly. The stupid old
thing, she would say to herself. To think that during all
those years she had never been able to buy a decent desk!
The poor old secrétaire, which, when it had contained a
fortune, had seemed to impart an air of wealth and gaiety
to the house, now only irritated her, and she looked upon
it as the abode of every evil, diffusing misfortune from
every chink.</p>

<p>One evening Pauline ran into the house from the yard,
crying, 'The baker's here! He says we owe him three days'
bread, two francs and eighty-five centimes.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau began to fumble in her pockets.</p>

<p>'I shall have to go upstairs,' she murmured.</p>

<p>'Stay here,' said the young girl carelessly. 'I will go for
you. Where's your money?'</p>

<p>'No, no, I'll go myself. You would never find it. It is
put away.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau stammered out these words, and she
and Pauline exchanged a silent glance, at which they both
grew pale. There was a moment of painful hesitation, and
then the aunt went upstairs, quite shivering with suppressed
anger, and feeling sure that her ward knew perfectly well
where she was going to get those two francs eighty-five
centimes. Why, she asked herself, had she always insisted
upon her presence when taking the money from the drawer?
The memory of her old scrupulous probity quite angered
her now, convinced as she was that her niece was following
her in imagination, and watching her as she opened the
drawer, took out the money, and then closed the secrétaire
again. After she had come downstairs and paid the baker,
her anger vented itself in an attack upon the girl.</p>

<p>'Good gracious! what a state your dress is in! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
have you been doing with yourself? You have been drawing
water for the kitchen, surely. Eh? Be good enough to let
Véronique do her own work, if you please. Upon my
word, I believe you have gone out of your way on purpose to
make a mess of yourself. You seem to have no idea that
your clothes cost money. I don't get so much for your keep
that it is easy to make both ends meet!'</p>

<p>And so she went on. Pauline had at first made some
slight attempt to defend herself, but she soon refrained, and
listened to her aunt in silence, with an aching heart. She
was quite conscious that the other's affection for her had
been on the wane for some time, and when she was alone
with Véronique she often gave way to tears. At those times
the servant would rattle the saucepans and affect to be
very busy, in order to excuse herself from taking notice or
siding with one party or the other. Although she was continually
growling at Pauline, she was now beginning to feel
some qualms of conscience and to doubt whether the girl was
receiving fair treatment.</p>

<p>When the winter came round again, Lazare grew quite
despondent. Once again his whim had changed; he began
to hate the works. There had been fresh pecuniary embarrassments
in November, and he had fallen into a perfect state of
panic. He had got over previous worries, but this one seemed
to reduce him to despair, to render him hopeless of everything;
and he began to revile science. The idea of making
anything out of sea-weed was ridiculous! They might
improve their system as much as they liked, but they would
never be able to drag out of Nature anything that Nature
didn't want them to have. He even fell foul of his master,
the great Herbelin himself, who, having been good enough to
visit the works at Golden Bay, had seemed quite distressed by
all the elaborate appliances, which, he said, were perhaps on too
large a scale to yield the results which had been obtained
with careful small experiments in his own laboratory. The
truth of the matter was, that, except in laboratory experiments
on a small scale, no means was yet known of maintaining
the low temperature which was necessary for the crystallisation
of the various substances. Lazare had, indeed, succeeded
in extracting a certain quantity of bromide of potassium from
sea-weed, but, as he could not sufficiently isolate the four or
five other bodies mingled with it, the result was failure. He
felt quite sick of the whole business, and confessed himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
beaten. One evening, when Madame Chanteau and Pauline
besought him to be calm and to make one last effort, there
came a very painful scene, when unkind recriminations were
indulged in, bitter tears shed, and doors banged with such
noisy violence that poor old Chanteau jumped up in his
arm-chair in sheer fright.</p>

<p>'You will end by killing me!' the young man screamed,
as he rushed away and locked himself up in his room, completely
overcome by childish despair.</p>

<p>At breakfast-time the next morning he brought down with
him a paper covered over with figures. Out of Pauline's
hundred and eighty thousand francs, nearly a hundred
thousand were already gone. Was there any sense in wasting
more money? It would all be lost. He was still under the
influence of the previous evening's alarm. His mother, too,
now seemed inclined to back him up. She had never been
able to go against him and vex him, even in his faults. It
was only Pauline who still tried to discuss the matter. The
announcement of the expenditure of those hundred thousand
francs quite dazed her. What! they had taken more than
half her fortune, and those hundred thousand francs would
be utterly lost if they did not try to struggle on! But her
arguments and persuasions were all in vain, and she went on
talking to no purpose till Véronique had cleared the table.
Then, to avoid breaking out into reproaches against them,
she rushed off to her own room, quite sick at heart.</p>

<p>There was a short interval of silence while the embarrassed
family lingered before the table.</p>

<p>'The girl is evidently avaricious,' said Madame Chanteau
at last. 'It is a pitiful failing, but I won't have Lazare
worried to death with all these bothers and vexations.'</p>

<p>Then Chanteau broke in timidly:</p>

<p>'I was never told that any such sum had been spent. It
is dreadful to think of. A hundred thousand francs!'</p>

<p>'Well, what of it!' interrupted his wife sharply. 'It
will be all repaid to her. If our son marries her, he is
certainly capable of making a hundred thousand francs.'</p>

<p>Then they began to discuss the best way out of this
difficulty. What had alarmed Lazare more than anything
else was a statement given to him by Boutigny, which showed
a most desperate condition of affairs. The debts amounted
to about twenty thousand francs; and, when Boutigny saw
that his partner was determined to retire, he expressed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
intention of going to Algeria, where, said he, there was a
splendid position awaiting him. But, afterwards, he came
to the conclusion that his best course would be to get the
works into his own possession. So he feigned such unwillingness,
and so complicated the accounts, that in the
end he managed to secure the site and buildings and apparatus
against payment of the twenty thousand francs debts;
and when, ultimately, Lazare succeeded in wringing out of
him some bills for five thousand francs, to be paid at intervals
of three months, he regarded it as quite a wonderful victory.
On the very next day Boutigny sold off the apparatus and
began to adapt the buildings for the manufacture of common
commercial soda, to be made in the ordinary routine way,
without any ultra-scientific process.</p>

<p>Pauline, who felt a little ashamed at her impulsive movement
in favour of prudence and economy, became quite
cheerful again and submissive, as though she recognised that
she had done something for which she ought to seek pardon.
When Lazare produced the bills for the five thousand francs,
Madame Chanteau was quite triumphant, and insisted upon
her niece going upstairs with her to see them put away in the
drawer.</p>

<p>'There, my dear, that's five thousand francs we've got
back. There they are: they are all for you. My son has
refused to keep a single one of them to repay him for all the
trouble he has had.'</p>

<p>Chanteau had been worried in mind for some time now.
Although he dared not refuse his signature when it was
asked of him, the way in which his wife was dealing with
their ward's fortune filled him with alarm. That total of a
hundred thousand francs was for ever ringing in his ears.
How could they possibly make up such a deficiency by the
time when the accounts would have to be examined? And
the worst of it all was that Saccard, the surrogate-guardian,
with the fame of whose speculations all Paris re-echoed, had
just recalled Pauline's existence, after apparently forgetting
all about her for nearly eight years. He had written to ask
after her, and had even spoken of calling at Bonneville one
day on his way to transact some business at Cherbourg.
What explanation could they possibly give him, if he were to
ask for an account of how matters stood, as he undoubtedly
had the right to do? This sudden awaking after such a long
period of utter indifference was very alarming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>When Chanteau at last spoke to his wife on the matter,
he found that she was much more affected by curiosity than
by alarm. For a moment, she felt sure that the truth of
the matter was that Saccard, with his gigantic speculations,
had suddenly found himself ruined, and had bethought
himself of getting hold of Pauline's money to try and regain
what he had lost. Then, directly afterwards, she began to
wonder whether it was not the girl herself who had written
to her surrogate-guardian out of some feeling of revenge.
But, when she found that her husband expressed the deepest
disgust at any such hypothesis, she began to indulge in complicated
suppositions of the most unlikely kind. Perhaps,
said she, that creature of Boutigny's, the hussy whom they
had refused to receive at their house, and who was running
them down in all the shops of Verchemont and Arromanches,
had written anonymous letters to Saccard.</p>

<p>'But they may do what they like, for all that,' she said.
'The girl is not eighteen yet, but we have only to marry
her straight off to Lazare, and the marriage will at once
make her complete mistress of her fortune.'</p>

<p>'Are you quite sure of that?' asked Chanteau.</p>

<p>'Of course I am. I was only reading it in the Code this
morning.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau had taken to studying the Code lately.
Her conscientious scruples were not quite extinct, and she
sought about her for reasons to allay them. Legal subtleties
had a special interest for her just now in the growing
decline of her honesty, which the temptation afforded by the
large sum of money in her keeping was gradually and completely
destroying.</p>

<p>However, she seemed to hesitate about actually bringing
the marriage scheme to an immediate issue. After the financial
disaster at the sea-weed works, Pauline herself had wished
to hasten affairs. What was the good of waiting another six
months till she should be eighteen? They had better get
married at once, without waiting for Lazare to look out for
other employment. She ventured to say as much to her aunt,
who, put out by the girl's frankness, had recourse to a lie. She
closed the door, and whispered that Lazare was really rendered
very unhappy by secret trouble. He was extremely sensitive,
and it would pain him very much to marry her before he was
able to bring her a fortune, now that he had compromised her
own. The girl listened to all this with great astonishment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
quite unable to understand any such romantic delicacy. What
did it matter? Even if he had been very rich, she would
have married him all the same, because she loved him.
Besides, how long would they have to wait? For ever, very
likely. Then Madame Chanteau protested, saying she would do
what she could to persuade him to overcome this exaggerated
sense of honour, if Pauline would only keep quiet and not try
to hurry matters; and, in conclusion, she made her niece swear
to say nothing on the subject, as she feared that the young
man might do something foolish, perhaps suddenly leave
home, if he found that his secret had been discovered and
discussed. Pauline, whom her aunt's remarks filled with uneasiness,
then promised to remain silent and patient. Chanteau,
however, continued to grow more and more afraid of Saccard,
and one day he said to his wife: 'If it can be managed,
Pauline and Lazare had much better be married at once.'</p>

<p>'There is no hurry,' she said. 'The danger is not at the
door yet.'</p>

<p>'But as they are to be married some day&mdash;&mdash;You haven't
changed your mind about it, eh? It will kill them if they
are separated.'</p>

<p>'Kill them, indeed! As long as a thing is not done, it
need not be done at all, if it should turn out inadvisable.
But they are quite free to do as they like, and we shall see if
they continue in the same mind.'</p>

<p>Pauline and Lazare had resumed all their old comradeship,
while the terribly severe winter kept them both confined
to the house. During the first week Lazare seemed so melancholy,
and so ashamed of himself and embittered by his ill-fortune,
that Pauline lavished all her tenderness upon him
and treated him as gently as though he were an invalid. She
felt great pity for that big young man, whose whimsical, enthusiastic
temperament, and mere nervous courage accounted
for all his failures, and she gradually began to assume a
sort of scolding mother-like authority over him. At first he
entirely lost his head and vowed that he would go and work
as a mere peasant; then he gave himself up to all kinds of
wild projects for making an immediate fortune, and declared
that he would not remain a burden on his family for another
day. But time slipped on, and he continually deferred
putting his plans into execution. Every morning he came
down with some new scheme which would at once lead to the
greatest wealth and honour. Pauline, frightened by her aunt's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
lying confidences, scolded him and asked him if he supposed
that anyone wanted him to go bothering himself in that way.
It would be soon enough for him to look out for something to
do when the spring came, and, no doubt, he would speedily be
successful; but, till then, it was necessary for him to rest.
At the end of a month she seemed to have gained the better
of him, and he fell into a state of dreamy idleness and cynical
resignation beneath what he called the burdens of life.</p>

<p>Every day now Pauline found some new trouble in Lazare
which upset her. His previous outbursts of temper and his
will-o'-the-wisp enthusiasm were preferable to this moody
cynicism and bitter profession of scepticism. Pessimism
acquired in Paris among fellow-students was reviving in him.
The girl could understand that angry disgust at his failure&mdash;the
catastrophe of the sea-weed scheme&mdash;lay at the bottom of
his railings against life. But she was not able to divine the
other influences at work in him, and had to confine herself to
indignant protests when he reverted to his old philosophy&mdash;the
denial of all progress and the futility of science. Wasn't
that beast of a Boutigny on the high road to fortune with his
wretched commercial soda? said Lazare. What was the good,
then, of ruining one's self to make something better, to discover
new laws and systems, when empiricism won the day?
This was his constant strain, and he would finish by saying,
with a bitter smile on his lips, that the only good thing science
could do would be to discover a way to blow the whole universe
into atoms by means of some colossal cartridge. Then he
frigidly jested on the will-power that directs the world and the
blind folly of wishing to live. All life, he said, was pain and
trouble, and he adopted the doctrine of the Hindoo fakirs, that
annihilation was the supreme blessing. When Pauline heard
him affecting a horror and disgust of all active motion, and
predicting the ultimate self-extinction of the nations, who one
day&mdash;when their intelligence was highly enough developed to
enable them to realise the imbecile, miserable part which an
unknown power made them play&mdash;would refuse to beget fresh
generations, she became indignant and tried to find arguments
to confute him; but all to no avail, for she was quite ignorant
of these matters, and, as her cousin told her, did not possess
a metaphysical head. Still, she would not allow she was
beaten, and roundly sent Schopenhauer to the devil when
Lazare wanted to read some extracts from his works to her.
Schopenhauer, indeed! A man who had written such horrid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
lies about women! If he had not shown a little affection for
animals she would have strangled him! Vigorous with robust
health herself, and full of cheerfulness and hope for the
morrow, she at last reduced her cousin to silence by her
merry laughter and youthful freshness.</p>

<p>'Stop! stop!' she would cry. 'You are talking nonsense.
We will think about dying when we have grown old.'</p>

<p>The idea of death, which she spoke of so lightly, always
affected him very painfully, and he quickly turned the conversation,
after murmuring:</p>

<p>'People die at all ages.'</p>

<p>Pauline at last understood that the thought of death was
terrible to Lazare. She called to mind his fear-stricken cry
that night as they lay on the beach gazing at the stars. At
the mention of certain things she saw him turn sickly pale,
shut himself up in moody silence, as though he were concealing
some disease whose existence he dared not confess. She
was greatly surprised at the fear of personal extinction felt
by this pessimist, who talked about snuffing out the stars
like so many candles amid the wreck of the whole universe.
This mental disease of Lazare's was of old standing, and the
girl did not guess the dangerous hold that it had obtained
upon her cousin. As he grew older, Lazare had seen death
rise before him. Till he was twenty years of age but a faint
chill had touched him when he went to bed. But now he
could not lay his head on his pillow without the thought of
Nevermore freezing his very blood. He tossed about, a prey
to sleeplessness, and could not resign himself to the fatal
necessity which presented itself so lugubriously to his
imagination.</p>

<p>And when, from sheer exhaustion, he had at last fallen
asleep, he would awake with a start, and spring up in bed,
his eyes staring wildly with terror and his hands clutching
one another, as he gasped in the darkness: 'O my God!
my God!' He would pant for breath and believe that he was
dying; and it was not till he had struck a light and
thoroughly awakened himself that he regained anything like
calmness. After these outbreaks of panic he always retained
a feeling of shame that he had allowed himself to cry out to a
God whose existence he denied, that he had yielded to the
hereditary weakness of the human race in calling amidst
its powerlessness for help. But every night he suffered in
this way, and even during the daytime a chance word or a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
momentary thought, arising from something he saw or read,
sufficed to throw him into a state of terror. One evening, as
Pauline was reading a newspaper to her uncle, Lazare hastily
rushed from the room, completely upset by the fancies of
some story-teller who pictured the skies of the twentieth
century filled with troops of balloons conveying travellers from
continent to continent. He had thought that he would no
longer be living then, that his eyes would never gaze upon
those balloons, which vanished into far-away centuries, the
idea of whose revolution, after his own complete extinction,
filled him with anguish. It was to no purpose that philosophers
reminded him that not a spark of life is ever utterly
lost; the <i>Ego</i> within him ragefully refused to accept its fate.
These inward struggles had already deprived him of his former
cheerfulness; and when Pauline, who could not always follow
the twists and turns of his morbid mind, looked at him at
those times when tormenting shame prompted him to conceal
his anguish, her heart melted with compassion; she burned
to show her love and do all she could to make him happier.</p>

<p>Their days were spent in the big room on the second floor,
amidst a litter of sea-weed, bottles, jars, and instruments,
which Lazare had never had the energy to clear away. The
sea-weed was falling to pieces and the bottles were growing
discoloured, while the instruments were getting damaged by
neglect. But in all this disorder Pauline and Lazare were
alone and warm. Frequently did the December rains beat
upon the slates of the roof from morning till night, while the
west wind roared organ-like through the crevices of the
woodwork. Whole weeks passed without sight of the sun,
and there was nothing for the eye to rest upon save the grey
sea&mdash;a grey immensity, in which the earth seemed to be
melting away. Pauline found amusement for her unoccupied
hours in classifying a collection of <i>floridæ</i> which she had
gathered during the previous spring. At first Lazare, with
his utter <i>ennui</i>, had just watched her as she mounted the
delicate forms, whose soft blues and reds showed like water-colours;
but afterwards, growing weary of his idleness, and
forgetting his theory of inaction, he unearthed the piano from
the litter of damaged appliances and dirty bottles beneath
which it was buried. A week later his passion for music had
resumed all its old sway over him. It was a revival of the
artistic sense which lay beneath his failure as a scientist and
a manufacturer. One morning, as he was playing his March<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of Death, the idea of the great symphony on Grief, which he
had once thought of composing, excited him again. All that
had been already written, except the March, was worthless, he
thought; and the March was the only portion he would
retain. But what a magnificent subject it was&mdash;what a
task to perform! And how he might embody all his philosophy
in it! He would commence with the creation of life
by the selfish caprice of some superior power. Then would
come the delusiveness of happiness and the mockery of life in
striking passages, an embrace of lovers, a massacre of soldiers,
and the death of a God upon the cross. Throughout everything
a cry of woe should ascend; the groans of humankind
should mount upwards to the skies, until came the
final hymn of deliverance, a hymn whose melting sweetness
should express all the happiness that came of universal
annihilation.</p>

<p>The next morning he set enthusiastically to work, jingling,
strumming on the piano, and covering sheets of paper with
black bars. As the instrument was in a more feeble condition
than ever, he sang the notes himself in a droning manner.
Never had any of his previous fads taken such strong hold
of him. He was so completely absorbed that he forgot
his meals, and all but deafened poor Pauline, who, in her
desire to please him, pretended that she liked it all very
much, and neatly recopied portions of the score. This time
he was quite sure that he had a masterpiece in hand.</p>

<p>But by-and-by his enthusiasm flagged. He had the whole
score written except the introduction, and inspiration for that
failed him. He would have to let it wait for a time, he said,
and he smoked cigarettes, while his manuscript lay upon the
table in front of him. Pauline played little bits from it on
the piano, with all a beginner's clumsiness. It was now that
the intimacy between the two young people began to assume
a dangerous character. Lazare's brain was no longer occupied;
and, shut up with Pauline in a state of idleness, he
began to feel for her a warmer passion than before. She was
so light-hearted and merry; so affectionate and devoted. At
first he thought that all he felt was a mere impulse of
gratitude, an amplification of that fraternal affection with which
she had inspired him ever since childhood. But by degrees
passion, hitherto dormant, awoke into life. In that younger
brother he was at last beginning to recognise a woman; and
he flushed as she did when he brushed against her. If their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
hands happened to meet, they both looked confused and their
breath came quickly, while their cheeks crimsoned. And thus
all the time they now spent alone together they felt troubled
and ill at ease.</p>

<p>Sometimes, to relieve them from embarrassment, Pauline
would begin to joke with all the frank boldness of her
innocent, though well-read mind.</p>

<p>'By the way,' said she, one day, 'did I tell you that I
dreamed that your favourite Schopenhauer had received
tidings in the other world of our marriage, and that his ghost
came to pay us a visit?'</p>

<p>Lazare laughed uneasily. He understood very well that
she was poking fun at his inconsistencies, but his whole
being was now thrilled with tenderness, which carried all his
distaste for existence away.</p>

<p>'Don't be naughty, dear,' he said. 'You know that I
love you.'</p>

<p>She assumed a chiding look.</p>

<p>'I am afraid you are inclined to put off the universal
deliverance. You are grovelling in egotism and delusions
again.'</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue, you wicked tease!'</p>

<p>He sprang up and chased her round the room, as she
continued to hurl at him fragments of pessimistic philosophy
with all the solemnity of a doctor of the Sorbonne. But
when he caught hold of her, he no longer dared to keep her
within his grasp, and pinch her for punishment as in olden
time.</p>

<p>One day when he was chasing her round the room, and
had succeeded in getting close, he clutched her by the waist.
She broke into a ringing laugh, while he, holding her against
the wardrobe, quivered with excitement as he felt her
struggling.</p>

<p>'Ah! I have got you this time!' he cried.</p>

<p>Their faces were touching, and she still laughed, though
in an uneasy manner.</p>

<p>'Please let me go,' she entreated. 'I won't be naughty
any more.'</p>

<p>He roughly planted a kiss on her lips. Then the whole
room appeared to swim round them and a hot feverish gust
seemed to sweep them into space. She staggered, and then,
with a sudden effort, released herself from her cousin's
grasp. For a moment they both stood silent and confused,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
their cheeks crimson as they avoided each other's glance.
At last Pauline dropped upon a chair to get her breath.</p>

<p>'You have hurt me, Lazare,' she said, speaking as though
she were seriously displeased with him.</p>

<p>From that day he guarded himself from contact with
her. His sense of honour rebelled against the thought of
any disgraceful lapse; he was quite conscious that in heart
and soul she was entirely his own; but he felt that respect
and protection were her due, and that in dangerous dallying
his would be the guilt alone. However, this very struggle
on his part only served to increase his love. Everything
lately had tended to fan its flame: the idleness of the
first few weeks, his assumed indifference as to what became
of him, his disgust with life, through which sprang a fresh
passionate desire of life and love and even suffering, as occupation
for his empty hours. And then music finally transported
his mind, carrying him away to a land of dreams
on spreading wings of melody. He began to believe that a
mighty passion possessed him, and vowed to cultivate it
for his genius' sake. He could no longer doubt it. He would
be a great musician, for he need only hearken to the
promptings of his heart. Everything then appeared to him
purified; he felt content to worship Pauline on his knees,
and did not even think of hurrying on their marriage.</p>

<p>'Come and read this letter I have just received,' said
Chanteau in alarm one day to his wife, who had just come up
from the village.</p>

<p>It was another letter from Saccard, and quite a threatening
one. Ever since November he had been asking for a
statement of the accounts of Pauline's fortune, and, as the
Chanteaus had only replied by evasions and subterfuges, he
now announced that he meant to lay the matter before the
family council. Madame Chanteau, though she would not
confess it, was quite as alarmed as her husband.</p>

<p>'The wretch!' she growled, when she had read the letter.</p>

<p>They looked at each other, quite pale and without finding
a word to say. They already seemed to hear in that lifeless
little dining-room the echoes of a disgraceful law-suit.</p>

<p>'There must be no more dilly-dallying,' resumed Chanteau.
'We must marry the girl at once, since marriage releases her
from all control.'</p>

<p>But to his wife this expedient seemed to grow more distasteful
every day. She expressed various fears. Who could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
tell if the two young folks would get on well together? It is
quite possible for people to agree as friends, and yet to make
each other perfectly miserable as man and wife. Lately, she
said, various unpleasant things had struck her.</p>

<p>'No,' she added; 'it would be wrong to sacrifice them
for the sake of our own peace. Let us wait a little longer.
And, besides, should we gain any advantage by marrying her
now? She was eighteen last month, and we can apply for
legal emancipation.'</p>

<p>She was beginning to feel quite confident again. She
went upstairs to get the Code, and they both pored over it
together. Article 478 tranquillised them, but they felt uneasy
again as they read Article 480, for there it was enacted that
the accounts of a ward's estate must be submitted to a curator
appointed by the family council. It was true that she could
easily manage all the members of the council, and make them
do what she wanted, but whom could she choose as curator?
The difficulty was to find some easy-going man, instead of
Saccard, the surrogate-guardian.</p>

<p>Suddenly she had an inspiration.</p>

<p>'I've got it,' she cried, 'Doctor Cazenove! He is somewhat
in our confidence, and he won't refuse.'</p>

<p>Chanteau nodded approval. He continued, however, to
look at his wife, as though revolving some thought in his
mind.</p>

<p>'And so,' he said at last, 'you will hand over the money?
What is left of it, I mean?'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau remained silent for a moment. Her
eyes sought the Code, whose pages she turned with nervous
excitement. Then with an effort she replied:</p>

<p>'Of course; and it will be a great relief to me to do so,
after the accusations that have already been made against us.
Upon my word, it is enough to make one suspect oneself! I
would give something to see the tiresome papers removed
from my secrétaire to-night. And, anyway, we should always
have to give them up to her.'</p>

<p>The next day, when Doctor Cazenove made his usual
Saturday round in Bonneville, she mentioned the great
service they awaited from his friendship. She made an
open breast of the situation, and told him how the money had
been swallowed up in the sea-weed works, without the family
council having been consulted in the matter. Then she
dwelt upon the intended marriage and the sad possibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
the bonds of affection which united them all together being
torn asunder by the scandal of a law-suit.</p>

<p>Before promising his assistance the doctor desired to have
an interview with Pauline. He had long suspected that she
was being taken advantage of, and that her fortune was
being gradually frittered away; and, though he had hitherto
said nothing for fear of causing her pain, he felt that now, as
he was being invited to become an accomplice, it was his duty
to warn her. The interview took place in the girl's own
room. At the commencement of the conversation her aunt
was present. She had accompanied the Doctor to declare
that the marriage now depended entirely on Pauline's emancipation
from the family council's control, as Lazare would
never consent to marry as long as it was possible for others
to accuse him of doing so for the mere purpose of avoiding
an examination of the accounts. Then she left the room,
saying that she did not wish to do anything to affect the
decision of the dear girl whom she already regarded as her
darling daughter. Pauline, quite overcome with emotion,
immediately begged the Doctor to render them the delicate
service the necessity of which had just been made clear to
him. It was to no purpose that Cazenove tried to explain
the exact position of affairs to her, to show her that she was
despoiling herself, reducing herself to a condition of absolute
dependence, or that he revealed his own fears for the future&mdash;perfect
ruin, possible ingratitude and suffering. At every
gloomy suggestion she uttered indignant protests, refused to
listen further, and showed a feverish haste to complete the
sacrifice.</p>

<p>'No! no! don't try to make me regret things. I am
really very avaricious at heart, though I don't let it appear.
It has given me a world of trouble to conquer myself. Let
them have everything. If they will only give me their love,
they may have all that belongs to me!'</p>

<p>'And so,' asked the Doctor, 'it is affection for your cousin
that leads you to strip yourself of your fortune?'</p>

<p>She blushed and did not reply.</p>

<p>'But suppose that after a time your cousin should cease
to love you?'</p>

<p>She stared at him with a frightened look. Her eyes filled
with big tears, and a cry of protesting love burst from her
heart. 'No! no! Why do you torture me like this?'</p>

<p>Then Doctor Cazenove consented to do as she wished.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
He could not summon up the courage to amputate that
generous heart of the illusions of love. Trouble would come
to her soon enough.</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau conducted the campaign with astonishing
brilliancy of intrigue. That struggle made her feel quite
young again. She set off to Paris once more, taking along
with her all the necessary powers and authorisations. She
quickly won the members of the family council over to her
own way of thinking. Those good people, indeed, had never
troubled about their duties; they showed the indifference
usual in such matters. The members of the council who
came from Quenu's side of the family, cousins Naudet,
Liardin, and Delorme, agreed with her at once; and as for
the three on Lisa's side, it was only upon Octave Mouret
that she had to expend any argument; the others, Claude
Lantier and Rambaud, who were both then living at
Marseilles, contented themselves with forwarding her their
written consent. To all of them she poured out a moving, if
somewhat confused, story, and spoke of the old Arromanches
surgeon's affection for Pauline, and his manifest intention to
leave her all his money should he be permitted to take her
under his care. As for Saccard, he, too, acquiesced, as the
others had done, after Madame Chanteau had paid him three
visits and suggested a brilliant new idea to him, the formation
of a ring in Normandy butter. Pauline's emancipation
was formally pronounced by the family council, and the
ex-naval surgeon Cazenove, of whom the Justice of the Peace
had received the most satisfactory account, was nominated
trustee.</p>

<p>A fortnight after Madame Chanteau's return to Bonneville
the auditing of the guardianship accounts took place
in the simplest manner. The Doctor had lunched with them,
and they sat lingering round the table, discussing the latest
news from Caen, whence Lazare had just returned after a two
days' visit, taken thither by the threat of an action on the
part of 'that scamp Boutigny.'</p>

<p>'By the way,' added the young man, 'Louise will give
you all a surprise when you see her next week. When I
saw her, I positively didn't recognise her. She is living with
her father now, and has grown into quite a fashionable young
lady. We had a very merry laugh over it.'</p>

<p>Pauline looked at him, feeling some surprise at the
warmth of his tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>'Talking of Louise,' interrupted Madame Chanteau, 'reminds
me that I travelled with a lady from Caen who knew
the Thibaudiers. I was quite thunderstruck when she told
me that Thibaudier would give his daughter a dowry of a
hundred thousand francs. With the other hundred thousand
which she had from her mother the girl will have two
hundred thousand. Two hundred thousand francs! She will
be quite wealthy!'</p>

<p>'She could do very well without all that,' said Lazare,
'for she's quite charming. And so kittenish in her ways!'</p>

<p>A gloomy expression thereupon came into Pauline's eyes,
and her lips twitched nervously. However, the Doctor, who
had never ceased watching her, lifted up his little glass of
rum, saying:</p>

<p>'Ah, we haven't clinked glasses yet! Here's to your health,
my young friends! Get married quickly and have plenty of
children.'</p>

<p>Without a smile Madame Chanteau slowly raised her
glass; while her husband, to whom liqueurs were forbidden,
contented himself with nodding his head approvingly.
Lazare, however, had just caught hold of Pauline's hand
with such an expression of affection that all the blood in
her heart had come pulsing to her cheeks. Was she not,
indeed, his good angel, whose love for him he would adorn
with the brilliance of genius? She returned the pressure of
his grasp. Then they all clinked glasses.</p>

<p>'To your hundredth birthday!' continued the Doctor, who
considered that a hundred years was a good and proper age
for a man to reach.</p>

<p>Lazare turned pale. The mention of those hundred
years sent a painful thrill through him, reminding him of the
time when he would have ceased to exist, the dread of which
everlastingly lurked within his mind. In a hundred years
where would he be, indeed? And what would he be? What
stranger would be seated drinking wine at that table where
he now sat? He raised his little glass with a trembling
hand; while Pauline, who had grasped hold of the other,
pressed it with a kind of maternal encouragement, as though
she had seen the icy quiver of 'Nevermore!' passing over his
pallid face. After a short interval of silence Madame
Chanteau said very seriously, 'And now suppose we get our
business over?'</p>

<p>She had settled that the formalities should be gone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
through in her own room. It would lend additional solemnity
to them, she thought. Chanteau had been able to walk
better since he had begun to take salicylic acid. With
the help of the banisters he climbed the stairs behind his
wife. Lazare talked about going on to the terrace to smoke
a cigar there; but his mother called him back, and insisted
upon his presence, which would only be seemly and proper,
she said.</p>

<p>The Doctor and Pauline had already gone on before.
Matthew, who looked at the procession with wondering
eyes, followed in the rear.</p>

<p>'That dog is quite a nuisance!' cried Madame Chanteau,
as she tried to shut the door. 'One can't go anywhere
without being followed by him. Well! well! come in,
then; I can't have you scratching outside. There! no one
will come and disturb us now. Everything, you see, is quite
ready.'</p>

<p>Some pens and an inkstand were all ready laid upon the
table. In the room one found all the closeness and mournful
silence that clings to places that are rarely occupied. Only
Minouche spent her idle hours there, when she could
manage to glide inside of a morning; and just now she
happened to be lying asleep on the middle of the eider-down
quilt. She raised her head in surprise at the invasion, and
stared at the new-comers with her green eyes.</p>

<p>'Sit down! Sit down!' said Chanteau.</p>

<p>Then things were quickly settled. Madame Chanteau
refrained from all share in the proceedings, leaving her
husband to play the part in which she had been carefully
coaching him since the day before. In conformity with the
requirements of the law, the latter, ten days previously, had
delivered to Pauline and the Doctor the accounts of his
guardianship in a bulky volume, where the expenses were
noted on one page and the receipts on the other. Everything
was charged for, not only Pauline's board and lodging,
but also the cost of the journeys to Paris and Caen. All
that had to be done was to accept the accounts by a private
deed. But Cazenove, taking his office of curator somewhat
seriously, wanted an explanation about some of the expenses
that had been incurred in connection with the sea-weed
works, and compelled Chanteau to enter into details. Pauline
cast a supplicating glance at the Doctor. What was the use
of all this? She herself had assisted in the preparation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the accounts, which her aunt had copied out in her most
elegant English&mdash;that is, angular&mdash;handwriting.</p>

<p>Meantime Minouche had sat up on the eider-down quilt,
the better to view these strange proceedings. Matthew, after
lying with his huge head stretched out on the carpet with an
air of great wisdom, had just thrown himself on his back and
was rolling and twisting about with noisy manifestations of
joy.</p>

<p>'Oh, do make him be still, Lazare!' cried Madame
Chanteau, quite impatient of the disturbance. 'One can't
hear one's self speak!'</p>

<p>The young man was looking out of the window, following
a far-off white sail with his eyes in order to conceal his
embarrassment. He experienced a feeling of deep shame as
he listened to his father, who was giving a detailed account of
the money lost in the works.</p>

<p>'Make a little less noise, Matthew!' he cried, reaching
out his foot.</p>

<p>The dog thought he was going to have his belly rubbed,
a proceeding which he dearly loved, and he grew more
demonstrative than ever. Happily, there was now nothing
more to be done than to affix the signatures. Pauline, with
a stroke of her pen, hastened to signify her approval of everything.
Then the Doctor, as if regretfully, scrawled a huge
flourish over the stamped paper. Painful silence fell.</p>

<p>'The assets,' said Madame Chanteau, breaking the silence,
'amount, then, to seventh-five thousand two hundred and ten
francs thirty centimes. I will now hand that sum to Pauline.'</p>

<p>She stepped towards the secrétaire and lowered the lid,
which gave out the creak that had so often distressed her.
But just now she was very grave, and, when she opened the
drawer, they saw the old ledger-binding inside. It was the
same as before, with its green-marble pattern stained with
grease spots, but it was not nearly so bulky; as the scrip was
removed it had grown thinner and thinner.</p>

<p>'No! no! aunt,' exclaimed Pauline, 'keep it!'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau protested:</p>

<p>'We are giving in our accounts,' she said, 'and we must
give up the money as well. It is your property. You
remember what I said to you when I put it there eight years
ago? We don't want to take a copper of it for ourselves.'</p>

<p>She drew out the papers and insisted on her niece counting
them. There was scrip for seventy-five thousand francs, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
a small packet of gold, wrapped up in a piece of newspaper,
completed the balance.</p>

<p>'But where am I to put it all?' asked Pauline, whose
cheeks flushed at the handling of so much money.</p>

<p>'Lock it up in one of your drawers,' her aunt replied.
'You are now big enough to take care of your own money.
I don't want to see it again myself. Stay! if you really find
it so troublesome, give it to Minouche, who is looking very
attentively at you.'</p>

<p>Now that the Chanteaus had settled their accounts, their
cheerfulness returned. Lazare, quite at his ease, began playing
with the dog, making him try to catch hold of his tail,
in such wise that he bent and twisted his spine and spun
round and round like a top. Doctor Cazenove, for his part, had
already entered upon his duties as trustee, and was promising
Pauline to receive her dividends for her and advise her on the
question of investments.</p>

<p>And precisely at that moment Véronique was bustling about
amongst her pans down below. She had crept upstairs,
and, with her ear at the keyhole, had overheard the statement
of accounts. For several weeks past a slowly growing
feeling of pity and affection for Pauline had been driving
away her remaining prejudices against the girl.</p>

<p>''Pon my word, they have swindled her out of half her
money!' she angrily growled. 'It's not right! Although
she had no business to come and settle herself down here,
still that was no reason why they should strip her as bare as
a worm. No! no! I know what is right, and I shall end
by quite loving the poor child!'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="IV" id="IV">IV</a></h3>


<p>On the following Saturday, when Louise, who had come on a
two months' visit to the Chanteaus, stepped on to the terrace,
she found the family there. The hot August day was drawing
to a close, and a cool breeze rose up from the sea.
Abbé Horteur had already made his appearance, and was
playing draughts with Chanteau. Madame Chanteau sat
near them, embroidering a handkerchief; and, a few yards
further away, Pauline stood in front of a stone seat on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
she had placed four children from the village, two little lads
and two little girls.</p>

<p>'What! you have got here already!' cried Madame
Chanteau. 'I was just folding up my work to go and meet
you at the cross-roads.'</p>

<p>Louise gaily explained that old Malivoire had flown along
like the wind. She was all right, she said, and did not even
want to change her dress; and, while her godmother went
off to see about her room, she hung her hat on the hasp of
a shutter. She kissed them all round, and then, all smiling
and caressing, threw her arms round Pauline's waist.</p>

<p>'Now, look at me,' she said. 'Good gracious! how we
have grown! I'm turned nineteen now, you know, and am
getting quite an old maid.'</p>

<p>And after a moment's silence she added rapidly:</p>

<p>'By the way, I must congratulate you. Oh! don't look
so shy! I hear it is settled for next month.'</p>

<p>Pauline had returned her caresses with the grave affection
of an elder sister, although in reality she was the younger
by some eighteen months. A slight blush rose to her cheeks
at the reference to her marriage with Lazare.</p>

<p>'Oh, no! you have been misinformed, really,' she replied.
'Nothing is definitely fixed, but it will perhaps be some time
in the autumn.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau, when pressed on the subject, had
indeed spoken of the autumn, in spite of her unwillingness
to commit herself to the match, an unwillingness which the
two young people were beginning to notice. She was again
beginning to harp upon her old excuse for delay, saying that
she should much prefer them waiting till Lazare should have
acquired some definite position.</p>

<p>'Ah! I see,' said Louise, 'you want to make a secret of it.
Well, never mind; but you'll ask me to come, won't you?
Where's Lazare? Isn't he here?'</p>

<p>Chanteau, who had just suffered a defeat at the hands of
the priest, here joined in the conversation, saying:</p>

<p>'Haven't you seen anything of him, Louise? We were
expecting you to get here together. He has gone to Bayeux
to make an application to the Sub-Prefect, but he will be back
again this evening&mdash;almost directly, I should think.'</p>

<p>Then he turned to the draught-board to commence a fresh
game.</p>

<p>'I move first this time, Abbé. We shall manage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
get those famous dykes made, I fancy; for the department
surely can't refuse to make us a grant to help on the undertaking.'</p>

<p>He was referring to a new scheme which Lazare had
taken up with his usual enthusiasm. During the spring-tides
of the previous March the sea had again carried away a
couple of houses at Bonneville. Devoured bit by bit on its
narrow bed of shingle, the village, it was clear, would be driven
to the very cliff unless some substantial protecting works
were quickly built. But the little place, with its thirty
cottages, was of such slight importance in the world that
Chanteau, as Mayor, had for the last ten years been vainly
calling the Sub-Prefect's attention to the perilous position of
the villagers. At last Lazare, spurred on by Pauline, whose
great wish was to see her cousin actively employed, had
conceived a grand idea of a system of piles and breakwaters
which would keep back the ravages of the sea. However,
money was wanted, and at least twelve thousand francs would
be necessary.</p>

<p>'Ah! I must huff you, my friend,' said the priest, taking
one of Chanteau's pieces.</p>

<p>Then he launched out into details of old Bonneville.</p>

<p>'The old folks say that there was once a farm below the
church, quite half a mile and more from the present shore.
For five hundred years the sea has been gradually eating
away the land. It is surely a punishment for the sins of their
ancestors.'</p>

<p>Pauline, however, had now returned to the stone seat,
where the four young ones were waiting, dirty, ragged, and
open-mouthed.</p>

<p>'Who is it you've got there?' Louise asked her, not daring
to venture too near them.</p>

<p>'Oh! they are some little friends of mine,' Pauline replied.</p>

<p>The girl's active charity now spread all over the neighbourhood.
She had an instinctive affection for the wretched, and
she was never repelled by their forlorn condition. She even
carried this feeling so far as to patch up the broken legs of
fowls with splinters of wood, and to set bowls of pap outside
at night for homeless cats. Distress of every kind was a
source of continual occupation to her, and to alleviate it was
her great pleasure. So the poor flocked round her with outstretched
hands, just as pilfering sparrows swarm round
the open windows of a corn-loft. All Bonneville, with its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
handful of fishermen thrown into distress by the sweeping
spring-tides, came up to see the 'young lady,' as they called her.
But it was the children who were her especial favourites, the
little things with ragged clothes, through which their pink
flesh peeped, poor, frail-looking, half-fed creatures, whose eyes
glistened wolfishly at the slices of bread and butter that she
brought out for them. The cunning parents took advantage of
Pauline's love for the children, making it a custom to send
her the most sickly and ragged that they had, in order that
they might increase her commiseration.</p>

<p>'You see,' she said, with a smile, 'I have my day at home,
Saturday, just like a fashionable lady, and my friends come
to see me. Now, now! little Gonin, just give over pinching
that silly Houtelard. I shall be cross with you if you don't
behave better. Now, we will begin in order.'</p>

<p>Then the distribution commenced. She lectured them,
and hustled them about in quite a maternal manner. The
first she called up to her was young Houtelard, a lad of some
ten years, with a sallow complexion and a gloomy timid expression.
He began to show her his leg. A big strip of skin had
been torn from the knee, and his father had sent him to let
the young lady see it, so that she might give him something
for it. It was Pauline who supplied arnica and liniments to
all the country round. The pleasure she took in healing had
resulted in the gradual acquisition of a complete collection of
drugs, of which she was very proud. When she had attended
to the lad's knee, she lowered her voice and proceeded to give
Louise some particulars about his relations.</p>

<p>'They are quite well-to-do people, those Houtelards, you
know; the only well-to-do fisher-folks in Bonneville. That
big smack, you know, belongs to them. But they are frightfully
avaricious, and live real dogs' lives in the midst of the
most horrible filth. The worst of it all is that the father, after
beating his wife to death, has married his servant, a dreadful
woman, who is even harsher than himself, and between them
they are gradually murdering the poor child.'</p>

<p>Then, without taking notice of her friend's repugnance,
she raised her voice again, and called another of the children.</p>

<p>'Now, little one, you come here; have you drunk your
bottle of quinine-wine?'</p>

<p>This child was the little daughter of Prouane, the verger.
She looked like an infant Saint Theresa, marked all over with
scrofula, flushed and frightfully thin, with big eyes, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
hysteria was already gleaming. She was eleven years old,
but seemed to be scarcely seven.</p>

<p>'Yes, Mademoiselle,' she stammered; 'I have drunk it all.'</p>

<p>'You little story-teller!' cried the priest, without taking
his eyes from the draught-board. 'Your father smelt strongly
of wine last night.'</p>

<p>Pauline looked extremely annoyed. The Prouanes had
no boat, but made their living by catching crabs and shrimps
and gathering mussels. With the additional profits of the
vergership they might have lived in decent comfort if it had
not been for their drinking habits. The father and mother
were often to be seen lying in their doorway stupefied by
'calvados,' the strong, raw, cyder-brandy of Normandy, while
the little girl stepped over their legs to drain their glasses.
When no 'calvados' was to be had, Prouane drank his
daughter's quinine-wine.</p>

<p>'And to think I took so much trouble to make it for you!'
said Pauline. 'Well, for the future, I shall keep the bottle
here, and you will have to come up every afternoon at five
o'clock. And I will give you a little minced raw meat. The
doctor has ordered it for you.'</p>

<p>It was next the turn of a big twelve-year-old boy, Cuche's
son, a lean and scraggy stripling. Pauline gave him a loaf,
some stewed meat, and also a five-franc piece. His was
another wretched story. After the destruction of their house
Cuche had deserted his wife, and gone to live with a female
cousin, and the wife was now taking refuge in an old dilapidated
Coastguard watch-house, where she led an immoral
life. The lad, who kept with her and shared the little she
had, was almost starving, but whenever any suggestion was
made of rescuing him from that wretched den he bolted off
like a wild goat. Louise turned her head away with an air
of disgust when Pauline, without the slightest embarrassment,
told her the boy's story. She, Pauline, had grown up
in a free unrestrained way, and looked with charity's unflinching
eye upon the vices of humanity. Louise, on the other
hand, initiated into knowledge of life by ten years spent at
boarding-schools, blushed at the ideas which Pauline's words
suggested. In her estimation these were matters which
people thought of, but should not mention.</p>

<p>'The other little girl there,' Pauline went on, 'that fair-haired
little child, who is so rosy and bonny, is the daughter
of the Gonins, with whom that rascal Cuche has taken up his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
quarters. She is nine years old. The Gonins were once very
comfortably off, and had a smack of their own, but the father
was attacked with paralysis in the legs, a very common complaint
in our villages about here, and Cuche, who was only a
common seaman to begin with, soon made himself the master.
Now the whole house belongs to him, and he bullies the poor
old man, who passes his days and nights inside an old coal-chest,
while Cuche and the wife lord it over him. I look
after the child myself, but I am sorry to say she comes in for
a good many cuffings at home, and is unfortunately much too
shrewd and noticing.'</p>

<p>Here Pauline stopped and turned to the child to question
her.</p>

<p>'How are they all getting on at home?' she asked.</p>

<p>The child had watched Pauline while the latter was
explaining matters in an undertone. Her pretty but vicious
face smiled slyly at what she guessed was being said.</p>

<p>'Oh, they've beaten him again,' she said, still continuing
to smile. 'Last night mother got up and caught hold of a
log of wood. Ah! Mademoiselle, it would be very good of
you to give father a little wine, for they have put an empty
jug by the chest, telling him that he may drink till he bursts.'</p>

<p>Louise made a gesture of disgust. What horrible people!
How could Pauline take any interest in such dreadful things?
Was it really possible that near a big town like Caen there
existed such hideous places, where people lived in that utterly
barbarous fashion?<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> For, surely, they could be nothing less
than savages, to thus trample under foot all law, both divine
and human.</p>

<p>'There! there! I have had quite enough of your young
friends,' she said, in a low tone, as she went to sit down near
Chanteau. 'I should not mourn for them very much if the
sea were to sweep them all away.'</p>

<p>The Abbé had just crowned a king.</p>

<p>'Sodom and Gomorrah!' he cried. 'I have been warning
them for the last twenty years. Well, it will be so much
the worse for them.'</p>

<p>'I have asked to have a school built here,' said Chanteau,
feeling a little distressed, as he saw the game going against
him; 'but there aren't people enough. The children ought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
to go to Verchemont, but they don't like school, and only play
about on the roads when they are sent there.'</p>

<p>Pauline looked up in surprise. If the poor things were
clean, she was thinking, there would be no necessity to
attempt to make them so. Wickedness and wretchedness
went together, and she felt in no way repelled by suffering,
even when it seemed to be the consequence of vice. But
she confined herself to asserting her charitable tolerance
with a gesture of protest. Then she went on to promise little
Gonin that she would go to see her father; and while she
was doing so Véronique appeared upon the scene, pushing
another little girl in front of her.</p>

<p>'Here's another, Mademoiselle.'</p>

<p>The new-comer, who was very young, certainly not more
than five years old, was completely in rags, with black face
and matted hair. With all the readiness of one already
accustomed to begging on the high-roads she at once began
to whine and groan:</p>

<p>'Please take pity upon me. My poor father has broken
his leg&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'It's Tourmal's girl, isn't it?' asked Pauline of Véronique.</p>

<p>But before the servant could reply the priest broke out
angrily:</p>

<p>'The little hussy! Don't take any notice of her. Her
father has been pretending to break his leg for the last five-and-twenty
years. They are a family of swindlers, who only
live by thieving. The father helps the smugglers. The
mother pilfers in all the fields about Verchemont, and the
grandfather prowls about at night, stealing oysters from the
Government beds at Roqueboise. You can see for yourselves
what they are making of their daughter&mdash;a little thief and a
beggar, whom they send to people's houses to lay her hands
upon anything that may happen to be lying about. Just
look how she is glancing at my snuff-box!'</p>

<p>The child's eyes, indeed, after inquisitively examining
every corner of the terrace, had flashed brightly on catching
sight of the priest's old snuff-box. She was not in the slightest
degree abashed by the Abbé's account of her family history,
but repeated her petition as calmly as though he had not
spoken a word.</p>

<p>'He has broken his leg. Please, kind young lady, help us
with a trifle.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>This time Louise broke out into a laugh. That little
five-year-old impostor, who was already as scampish as her
parents, quite amused her. Pauline, however, remained
perfectly grave and serious, and took a new five-franc piece
from her purse.</p>

<p>'Now, listen to me,' she said; 'I will give you as much
every Saturday if I hear a good account of you during the
week.'</p>

<p>'Look after the spoons, then,' Abbé Horteur cried, 'or she
will walk off with some of them.'</p>

<p>Pauline made no reply to this remark, but dismissed the
children, who slouched off with exclamations of 'Thank you
kindly' and 'May God reward you!'</p>

<p>While this scene had been taking place Madame Chanteau,
who had just come back from the house, whither she had
gone to give a glance at Louise's room, was muttering with
vexation at Véronique. It was quite intolerable that the
servant should take upon herself to introduce those wretched
beggars. Mademoiselle herself brought quite sufficient of them
to the house. A lot of scum, who robbed her of her money
and then laughed at her! Of course the money was her own,
and she could play ducks and drakes with it if she were
so disposed, but it was really becoming quite immoral to
encourage vice in this way. She had heard Pauline promise
a hundred sous a week to the little Tourmal girl. Another
twenty francs a month! The fortune of an emperor would
not suffice for such perpetual extravagance!</p>

<p>'You know very well,' she said to Pauline, 'that I hate to
see that little thief here. Though you are now the mistress
of your fortune, I cannot allow you to ruin yourself so foolishly.
I am morally responsible. Yes, my dear, I repeat
that you are ruining yourself, and more quickly than you
have any notion of.'</p>

<p>Véronique, who had gone back to her kitchen, fuming with
anger at Madame Chanteau's reprimand, now reappeared.</p>

<p>'The butcher's here!' she cried roughly. 'He wants his
bill settled; forty-six francs ten centimes.'</p>

<p>A pang of vexation curtailed Madame Chanteau's remarks.
She fumbled in her pocket, and then, assuming an expression
of surprise, she whispered to Pauline:</p>

<p>'Have you got as much about you, my dear? I have no
change here, and I shall have to go upstairs. I will give it
you back very shortly.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>Pauline went off with the servant to pay the butcher.
Since she had begun to keep her money in her chest of drawers
the same old comedy had been enacted each time a bill was
presented for payment. It was a systematic levy of small
amounts which had grown to be quite a matter of course.
Her aunt no longer troubled to go and withdraw the money
herself, but asked Pauline for it, and thus made the girl rob
herself with her own hands. At first there had been a
pretence of settling accounts, and sums of ten and fifteen
francs had been repaid to her, but afterwards matters got so
complicated that a settlement was deferred till later on, when
the marriage should take place. Yet, in spite of all this, they
took care that she should pay for her board with the greatest
punctuality on the first day of every month, the sum due in
this respect being now raised to ninety francs.</p>

<p>'There's some more of your money making itself scarce!'
growled Véronique in the passage. 'If I had been you, I
would have told her to go and find her change. It is
abominable that you should be plundered in this way!'</p>

<p>When Pauline came back with the receipted account,
which she handed to her aunt, the priest was radiant with
triumph. Chanteau was vanquished; he had not a piece
which he could move. The sun was setting, and the sea
was crimsoned by its oblique rays, while the tide lazily rose.
Louise, with a far-off look in her eyes, smiled at the bright
and wide-stretching horizon.</p>

<p>'There's our little Louise up in the clouds,' said Madame
Chanteau. 'I have had your trunk taken upstairs, Louisette.
We are next-door neighbours again.'</p>

<p>Lazare did not return home till the following day. After
his visit to the Sub-Prefect at Bayeux he had taken it into
his head to go on to Caen and see the Prefect. And, though
he was not bringing an actual subvention back in his pocket,
he was convinced, he said, that the General Council<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> would
vote at the least a sum of twelve thousand francs. The
Prefect had accompanied him to the door and had bound
himself by formal promises, saying that it was impossible
Bonneville should be left to its fate, and that the authorities
were quite prepared to back up the efforts of the inhabitants.
Lazare, however, could not help feeling despondent, for he
foresaw all sorts of delays, and the least delay in the carrying-out
of one of his schemes proved agony to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>'Upon my word of honour,' he cried, 'if I had the twelve
thousand francs myself, I should be delighted to advance
them! For the first experimental proceedings, indeed, so
much would not be necessary. When we do get the money
voted, you will see what a heap of worries and delays we shall
have to go through. We shall have all the engineers in the
department down here on our backs. But if we could make
a start without them, they would be obliged to acquiesce in
what had actually been done. The Prefect, to whom I briefly
explained our plans, was quite struck with their advantage
and simplicity.'</p>

<p>The hope of overpowering the sea now thrilled him
feverishly. He had felt bitter rancour against it ever since
he had considered it responsible for his failure with the sea-weed
scheme; and, though he did not venture to openly revile
it, he harboured the thought of coming vengeance. And
what revenge could be better than to stay it in its course of
blind destruction, and call out to it, like its master, 'Thus
far and no farther'?</p>

<p>There was, also, in this enterprise an element of philanthropy
which, joined to the grandeur of the contemplated
struggle, brought his excitement to a climax. When his
mother saw him spending his days cutting out pieces of wood
and burying his nose in treatises on mechanics, she thought,
with trembling, of his grandfather, the enterprising but
blundering carpenter, whose useless masterpiece lay slumbering
in its glass case on the mantelshelf. Was the old man
going to live over again in his grandson to consummate the
ruin of the family? Then she gradually allowed herself to be
convinced and won over by the son whom she worshipped.
If he were successful, and, of course, he would be successful,
this would be the first step to fame, glorious and disinterested
work which would make him celebrated. With this as a
starting-point he might easily soar as high as ambition might
prompt him. Henceforth the whole family dreamt of nothing
but conquering the sea and of chaining it to the foot of the
terrace, submissive like a whipped dog.</p>

<p>Lazare's scheme was, as he had said, one of great simplicity.
He proposed to drive big piles into the sand, and to
cover them with planks. Behind these the shingle, swept up
by the tide, would form a sort of impregnable wall against
which the waves would break powerlessly, and, by this
means, the sea itself would build the barrier which was to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
keep it back. A number of groynes, built of long beams carried
upon strong rafters forming a breakwater in front of the wall
of shingle, would complete the works. Afterwards, if they
had the necessary funds, they might construct two or three
big stockades, whose solid mass would restrain the very
highest tides. Lazare had found the first idea of his scheme
in a 'Carpenter's Complete Handbook,' a little volume with
quaint engravings, which had probably been bought long ago
by his grandfather. He elaborated and perfected the idea,
and went into the matter pretty deeply, studying the theory
of forces and the resistance of which the different materials
were capable, and manifesting considerable pride in a certain
disposition and inclination of the beams, which, said he, could
not fail to insure absolute success.</p>

<p>Pauline once more showed great interest in her cousin's
studies. Like the young man's, her curiosity was always
aroused by experiments in strange things. But, with her
more calculating nature, she did not deceive herself as to
the possibility of failure. When she saw the tide mount up,
her eyes wandered with an expression of doubt to the models
which Lazare had made, the miniature piles and groynes and
stockades. The big room was now quite full of them.</p>

<p>One night the girl lingered till very late at her window.
For the last two days her cousin had been talking of burning
all his models; and one evening, as they all sat round the
table, he had exclaimed in a sudden outburst that he was
going off to Australia, as there was no room for him in
France. Pauline was meditating over all this by her window,
while the flood-tide dashed against Bonneville in the darkness.
Each shock of the waves made her quiver, and she
seemed to hear, at regular intervals, the cries of poor
creatures whom the sea was swallowing up. Then the
struggle which was still waging within her between love of
money and natural kindliness became unendurable, and she
closed the window, that she might no longer hear. But the
distant blows still seemed to shake her as she lay in bed.
Why not try to attempt even what seemed impossible?
What would it matter, throwing all this money into the sea,
if there were yet a single chance of saving the village?
And she fell asleep at daybreak dreaming of the joy her
cousin would feel when he should find himself released from
all his brooding melancholy, set at last perhaps on the
right path, happy through her, indebted to her for everything.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>In the morning, before going downstairs, she called him.
She was laughing.</p>

<p>'Do you know that last night I dreamt that I had lent
you those twelve thousand francs?'</p>

<p>But Lazare became angry and refused in violent words:
'Do you want to make me set off and never come back
again? No! we lost quite enough over the sea-weed works.
I am really dying of shame about it, though I told you
nothing.'</p>

<p>Two hours later, however, he accepted Pauline's offer,
and pressed her hands in a passionate outburst of gratitude.
It was to be an advance and nothing more. Her money
would be running no risk, for there was not the least doubt
that the subvention would be voted by the Council, the more
especially if operations were actually commenced. That
very evening the Arromanches carpenter was called in. There
were endless consultations and walks along the coast, with a
perpetual discussion of estimates. The whole family went
wild over the scheme.</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau, however, had first flown into a
tantrum on hearing of the loan of the twelve thousand francs.
Lazare was astonished, unable to understand. His mother
overwhelmed him with strange arguments. No doubt, said
she, Pauline advanced small sums to them from time to
time, but, if this kind of thing were to go on, she would
begin to think herself indispensable. It would have been
better to have asked Louise's father for an advance. Louise
herself, who would have a dowry of two hundred thousand
francs, did not make nearly so much fuss about her money.
Those two hundred thousand francs of Louise's were ever on
Madame Chanteau's lips, and seemed to fill her with angry
contempt for the remnants of that other fortune which had
dwindled away in the secrétaire and was still dwindling in
the chest of drawers.</p>

<p>Chanteau, too, instigated by his wife, pretended to be
greatly vexed. Pauline felt very much hurt. She recognised
that they loved her less now, even though she was
giving them her money. There seemed to be a bitter feeling
against her, which increased day by day, though she could
not even guess the cause of it. As for Doctor Cazenove,
he found fault with her, too, when she mentioned the subject
to him as a matter of form, but he had been obliged to
acquiesce in all the loans, the large as well as the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
ones. His office of trustee was a mere fiction; he found
himself quite disarmed in that house, where he was always
received as an old friend. On the day when the twelve
thousand francs were lent to Lazare he renounced all further
responsibility.</p>

<p>'My dear,' he said, as he took Pauline aside, 'I cannot go
on being your accomplice. Don't consult me any more; ruin
yourself just as you like. You know very well that I can
never resist your entreaties; but I am really very much
troubled about them afterwards. I would rather remain
ignorant of what I cannot approve.'</p>

<p>Pauline looked at him, deeply moved. After a moment's
silence she replied:</p>

<p>'Thank you, my dear friend. But am I not really taking
the right course? If it makes me happy, what does anything
else matter?'</p>

<p>He took her hands within his own and pressed them in a
fatherly manner, with an expression of affection that was
tinged with sadness.</p>

<p>'Well! if it does make you happy! After all, one has to
pay quite as much sometimes to make one's self miserable.'</p>

<p>As might have been expected, in the enthusiasm of his
approaching struggle with the sea Lazare had entirely
abandoned his music. There was a coating of dust upon the
piano, and the score of his great symphony was put away at
the bottom of a drawer; a service which he owed to Pauline,
who collected the different sheets together, finding some of
them hidden even behind the furniture. With certain portions
of the work he had grown much dissatisfied, and had
begun to think that the celestial joy of final annihilation,
which he had expressed in a somewhat commonplace fashion
in waltz time, would be better rendered by a very slow
march. One evening, indeed, he had declared that he would
re-write the whole work when he had the leisure.</p>

<p>His flash of desire and feeling of uneasiness in the society
of his young cousin seemed to disappear when his musical
enthusiasm drooped. His masterpiece must be deferred to a
more suitable time, and his passion, which he also seemed
able to advance or retard, must be similarly postponed. He
again began to treat Pauline as an old friend or long since
wedded wife, who would fall into his arms as soon as ever
he chose to open them. Since April they had not shut
themselves up in the house so much, and the fresh air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
brought life and colour to their cheeks. The big room was
deserted, while they rambled about the rocky shore of
Bonneville, studying the best situations for the piles and
stockades. And, after dabbling about in the water, they
came home as tired and as easy in mind as in the far-away
days of childhood. When Pauline sometimes played the
famous March of Death to tease him, Lazare would cry out:</p>

<p>'Do be quiet! What a lot of rubbish!'</p>

<p>On the evening of the carpenter's visit, however, Chanteau
was seized with another attack of gout. He now had a
fresh attack almost every month. The salicylic treatment,
which at first had given him some relief, seemed in the end
to add to the violence of his seizures. For a fortnight
Pauline remained a close prisoner at her uncle's bedside.
Lazare, who was continuing his investigations on the beach,
then invited Louise to go with him, by way of freeing her
from the cries of the sick man, which quite frightened her.
As she occupied the guests' bedroom, the one just above
Chanteau's, she had to stuff her fingers into her ears and
bury her head in the pillows at night-time in order to get
some sleep. But when she was out of doors she became
radiant again, enjoying the walk immensely and forgetting
all about the poor man groaning in the house.</p>

<p>They had a delightful fortnight. The young man had at
first gazed on his companion with surprise. She was a great
change from Pauline; she cried out whenever a crab scuttled
past her shoe, and was so frightened of the sea that she
thought she was going to be drowned whenever she had to
jump over a pool. The shingle hurt her little feet, she
never relinquished her sunshade, and was for ever gloved
up to her elbows, being in a constant state of fear lest her
delicate skin should be exposed to the sun's rays. After his
first astonishment, however, Lazare allowed himself to be
attracted by her pretty airs of timidity, and her weakness,
that ever seemed to be appealing to him for assistance. She
did not smell simply of the breezy air, like Pauline; she
intoxicated him with a warm odour of heliotrope, and he no
longer had a boy-like companion at his side, but a young
woman, whose presence now and then sent his blood pulsing
hotly through his veins. True, she was not as pretty as
Pauline; she was older, and seemed already a little faded,
but there was a bewitching charm about her; her small limbs
moved with easy supple motion, and her whole coquettish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
figure seemed instinct with promises of bliss. She appeared
to Lazare to be quite a discovery on his part; he could
recognise in her no trace of the scraggy little girl he
had formerly known. Was it really possible that long years
at boarding-school had turned that very ordinary-looking
child into such a disquieting young woman, who, maiden
though she was, seemed by no means shy? Little by little
Lazare found himself possessed by growing admiration,
disturbing passion, in which the mere friendship of childhood
disappeared.</p>

<p>When Pauline was able to leave her uncle's bedroom and
resume companionship with Lazare, she immediately noticed
a change between him and Louise, unaccustomed glances and
laughs, in which she had no share. For the first few days
she maintained a sort of maternal attitude, treating the pair
as foolish young things whom a mere nothing was sufficient
to amuse. But she soon grew low-spirited, and the walks
they all took abroad seemed to weary her. She never made
any complaint, she simply spoke of persistent headaches; but,
later on, when her cousin advised her to stay at home, she
became vexed, and would not quit him even in the house.
On one occasion, about two o'clock in the morning, Lazare,
who had sat up in his room working at a plan, thought he
heard some steps outside, and opened his door to look.
Thereupon he was astonished to see Pauline in her petticoats
leaning over the banisters in the dark, and listening. She
declared that she thought she had heard a cry downstairs.
But she blushed as she told this fib, and Lazare did the
same, for a suspicion flashed through his mind. From that
night forward, without anything being said, friendly relations
suffered. Lazare considered that Pauline made herself very
ridiculous by pouting and sulking about mere nothings, while
she, continually growing more gloomy, never once left her
cousin alone with Louise, but kept a strict watch over them,
and tortured herself with fancies at night if she had caught
them speaking softly to each other as they walked home from
the shore.</p>

<p>However, the work had begun. A body of carpenters,
after nailing a number of heavy planks across a framework
of piles, succeeded in completing a first buttress against
the sea's attack. This was simply meant as a trial, which
they hurried along with, in expectation of a flood tide. If
the timbers should be able to resist the sea's approach, then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
the system of defence would be completed. It unfortunately
happened that the weather was execrable. Rain fell continually,
and all Bonneville got soaked to the skin in going
out to see the piles rammed into the sand. Then, on the
morning when the high tide was expected, an inky pall hung
over the sea, and, from eight o'clock the rain fell with
redoubled violence, hiding the horizon with a dense cold mist.
There was immense disappointment, for the Chanteaus had
been planning to go in a family party to watch the victory
which their beams and piles would win over the attacking
flood.</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau determined to remain at home with
her husband, who was still far from well. Great efforts,
too, were made to induce Pauline to stay indoors, as she had
been suffering from a sore throat for a week past, and
always grew a little feverish towards the evening. But she
rejected all the prudent advice that was offered her, resolving
to go down to the beach, since Lazare and Louise were going.
Louise, fragile as she appeared to be, ever, so it seemed, on
the verge of fainting, really proved a girl of great physical
endurance, particularly when any kind of pleasure made her
excited.</p>

<p>They all three set off after breakfast. A sudden breeze
had swept away the clouds, and glad smiles hailed the
unexpected change. The patches of blue sky overhead were
so large, though they still mingled with black masses, that
the girls refused to take any other protection than their sun-shades.
Lazare alone carried an umbrella. He would see
that they came to no harm, he said, and would place
them under shelter somewhere should the rain begin to
fall again.</p>

<p>Pauline and Louise walked on in front. However, on the
steep slope leading down towards Bonneville, the latter
stumbled on the wet and slippery soil, and Lazare rushed up
to support her. Pauline then followed behind them. Her
high spirits quickly fell, as with a jealous glance she noticed
her cousin's arm pressed closely against Louise's waist.
The contact of the two soon absorbed her; all else disappeared&mdash;the
beach, where the fishermen of the neighbourhood
stood waiting in a somewhat scoffing mood, and the
rising tide, and the stockade already white with foam. Away
on the right arose a mass of dark clouds, lashed on by the
gale.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>'What a nuisance!' said the young man; 'we are going
to have more rain. But we shall have time to see things
before it comes on, I think, and then we can take refuge close
at hand with the Houtelards.'</p>

<p>The tide, which had the wind against it, was rising with
irritating slowness. The wind would certainly keep it from
mounting as high as had been expected. Still no one left
the shore. The new groyne, which was now half covered,
seemed to work very satisfactorily, parting the waves, whose
diverted waters foamed up to the very feet of the spectators.
But the greatest triumph was the successful resistance of the
piles. As each wave dashed against them, sweeping the
shingle with it, they heard the stones falling and collecting
on the other side of the beams with a noise like the
sudden discharge of a cartload of pebbles; and this wall
which was thus gradually building itself up seemed to guarantee
success.</p>

<p>'Didn't I tell you so?' cried Lazare. 'You won't make
any more jokes about it now, I think!'</p>

<p>Prouane, who was standing near him, and had not been
sober for the last three days, shook his head, however, as he
stammered: 'We shall see about that when the wind blows
against it.'</p>

<p>The other fishermen kept silent. But the expression on
the faces of Cuche and Houtelard plainly showed that they
felt little confidence in all such contrivances; indeed, they
would scarcely have felt pleased to see their enemy the sea,
which crushed them so victoriously, beaten back by that
stripling of a landsman. How they would laugh when the
waves some day carried off those beams like so many straws!
The very village might be dashed to pieces at the same time;
it would be rare fun all the same!</p>

<p>Suddenly the rain began to fall; great drops poured
from the lurid clouds, which had covered three-quarters of
the sky.</p>

<p>'Oh! this is nothing!' cried Lazare in a state of wild
enthusiasm. 'Let's stay a little longer. Just look! not a
single pile moves!' While speaking he set his umbrella over
Louise's head. She pressed to his side with the air of a
frightened turtle-dove. Pauline, whom they seemed to have
forgotten, never ceased to watch them. She felt enraged; the
warmth of their clasp seemed to set her cheeks on fire. But
the rain was now coming down in a perfect torrent, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
Lazare suddenly turned round and called to her: 'What are
you thinking of? Are you mad? At all events, open your
sunshade!'</p>

<p>She was standing stiffly erect beneath the downpour,
which she did not seem to notice. And she simply answered
in a hoarse voice: 'Leave me alone. I am all right.'</p>

<p>'Oh! Lazare!' cried Louise, quite distressed, 'make her
come here! There is room under the umbrella for all three
of us.'</p>

<p>But Pauline, in her angry obstinacy, did not condescend
to notice the invitation. She was all right; why couldn't
they let her alone? And when Lazare, at the conclusion of
his fruitless entreaties, finished by saying: 'It's folly! Let's
run to the Houtelards!' she answered rudely, 'Run wherever
you like. I came here to see, and I mean to stop.'</p>

<p>The fishermen had fled. Pauline remained alone beneath
the pouring rain, with her eyes turned towards the piles,
which were now covered by the waves. The spectacle
seemed to absorb all her attention, in spite of the grey mist
which was rising from the rain-beaten sea, obscuring everything.
Big black marks appeared on her streaming dress,
about her shoulders and arms, but she would not leave her
place till the west wind had swept the storm-cloud away.</p>

<p>They all three returned home in silence. Not a word
of what had happened was mentioned to Madame Chanteau.
Pauline hurried off to change her clothes, while Lazare
recounted the complete success of the experiment. In the
evening, as they sat at table, Pauline became feverish, but she
pretended there was nothing the matter with her, in spite of
the evident difficulty she had in swallowing her food; and she
even ended by speaking very roughly to Louise, who evinced
solicitude in her caressing way, and perpetually asked her
how she felt.</p>

<p>'The girl is really growing quite unbearable with her bad
disposition,' murmured Madame Chanteau behind Pauline's
back. 'We had better give over speaking to her.'</p>

<p>About one o'clock in the morning Lazare was roused by
a hoarse cough, which sounded so distressingly that he sat up
in bed to listen. At first he thought it came from his mother;
then, as he went on straining his ear, he heard a noise as of
something falling, and his floor shook. Forthwith he jumped
out of bed and hastily put on his clothes. It could only be
Pauline, who must have fallen on the other side of the wall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
He broke several matches with his trembling hands, but, at
last, when he had succeeded in lighting his candle and came
out of his room, he found the door opposite wide open, and
the young girl lying on her side and barring the entrance.</p>

<p>'What is the matter?' Lazare cried in amazement.
'Have you fallen?'</p>

<p>It had just flashed through his mind that she was prowling
about again, playing the spy. But she made no reply, and
never even stirred; in fact, with her closed eyes, she seemed
to him to be dead. There could be no doubt that just as she
was leaving her room to seek assistance a fainting-fit had
thrown her on the ground.</p>

<p>'Pauline, speak to me, I beg you! What is the matter
with you?'</p>

<p>He had bent down and was holding the light to her face.
She was extremely flushed, and seemed a prey to violent fever.
Then all hesitation on his part vanished, and he took her up
in his arms and carried her to her bed full of fraternal
anxiety. When he had placed her in bed again, he began to
question her once more, 'For goodness' sake, do speak to me!
Have you hurt yourself?'</p>

<p>She had just opened her eyes, but she could not yet speak,
and merely looked at him with a fixed gaze. Then, as he
still continued to press her with questions, she carried her
hand to her throat.</p>

<p>'It is your throat that hurts you, is it?'</p>

<p>At last, in a strange voice, that seemed to come with
immense difficulty, she gasped:</p>

<p>'Don't make me speak, please. It hurts me so.'</p>

<p>As she said this she was seized with another attack of
coughing, the same hoarse guttural cough that he had heard
from his bedroom. Her face turned bluish, and her distress
became so great that her eyes filled with tears. She lifted
her hands to her poor trembling brow, which was quivering
with the hammer-like throbs of a frightful headache.</p>

<p>'You caught that to-day!' he stammered, quite distracted.
'It was very foolish of you to act as you did, when
you were already far from well!' But he checked himself, as
he saw her looking up at him with a gaze of entreaty.</p>

<p>'Just open your mouth and let me look at your throat.'</p>

<p>It was all she could do to open her jaws. Lazare brought
the candle close to her, and was with difficulty able to espy
the back of her throat, which was dry, and gleamed with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
bright crimson. It was evidently a case of angina, and her
burning fever and terrible headache filled him with alarm as
to its precise nature. The poor girl's face wore such an
agonised expression of choking that he was seized with a
horrible fear of seeing her suffocated before his very eyes.
She was not able to swallow; every attempt to do so made
her whole body quiver. At last a fresh attack of coughing
threw her into another fainting-fit; and thereupon in a
state of complete panic he flew off to thump at Véronique's
door.</p>

<p>'Véronique! Véronique! Get up! Pauline is dying.'</p>

<p>When Véronique, half-dressed and scared, entered the
girl's room, she found Lazare excitedly talking to himself in
the middle of it.</p>

<p>'What a forsaken hole to be in! One might die here like
a dog! There is no help to be had nearer than a couple of
miles!'</p>

<p>He strode up to Véronique.</p>

<p>'Try and get someone to go for the Doctor immediately,'
he said.</p>

<p>The servant stepped up to the bed and looked at the sick
girl. She was quite alarmed at seeing her so flushed, and in
her increasing affection for Pauline, whom she had at first so
cordially detested, she felt a painful shock.</p>

<p>'I'll go myself,' she said quietly. 'That will be the
quickest way. Madame will be quite able to light a fire downstairs,
if you want one.'</p>

<p>Then, scarcely yet fully awake, she put on her heavy boots
and wrapped a shawl round her; and, after telling Madame
Chanteau what the matter was as she went downstairs, she
set off, striding along the muddy road. Two o'clock rang out
from the church, and the night was so dark that she stumbled
every now and then against heaps of stones.</p>

<p>'What is it, then?' asked Madame Chanteau, as she came
upstairs.</p>

<p>Lazare scarcely answered her. He had just been ferreting
about in the cupboard for his old medical treatises, and was
now bending down before the chest of drawers, turning over
the pages of one of his books with trembling fingers, while
trying to remember something of what he had formerly learnt.
But he grew more and more confused, and perpetually turned
to the index without being able to find what he wanted.</p>

<p>'It's only a bad sick headache,' said Madame Chanteau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
who had sat down. 'The best thing we can do is to leave
her to sleep.'</p>

<p>At this Lazare burst out angrily:</p>

<p>'A sick headache! A sick headache indeed! You will
drive me quite mad, mother, by standing there so unconcernedly.
Go down stairs and get some water to boil.'</p>

<p>'There is no necessity to disturb Louise, is there?' she
asked.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, not the least. I don't require anybody's
assistance. If I want anything I will call you.'</p>

<p>When he was alone again, he went and took hold of
Pauline's wrist to try her pulse. He counted one hundred
and fifteen pulsations; and he felt the girl's burning hand
cling closely and lingeringly to his own. Her heavy eyelids
remained closed, but she was thanking him and forgiving
him with that pressure of her hand. Though she was unable
to smile, she still wanted to let him understand that she had
heard and was pleased to know that he was there alone with
her, without a thought for anybody else. Generally, he had
a horror of all suffering, and took himself off at the slightest
appearance of indisposition in any of his relatives, for he was
a shockingly bad nurse, and was so unable to control his
nerves that he ever feared lest he should burst out crying.
And so it was a pleasant surprise to Pauline to see him now
so anxious and devoted. He himself could not have explained
the warmth of feeling that was upbuoying him, or the
necessity he felt of relying on himself alone to give her relief.
The pressure of her little hand upset him, and he tried to
cheer her.</p>

<p>'It's nothing at all, my dear. I am expecting Cazenove
directly; but we needn't feel the least alarm.'</p>

<p>She still kept her eyes closed as she murmured, apparently
still in pain: 'Oh! I'm not at all frightened. What troubles
me most is to see you so much disturbed.'</p>

<p>Then, in a still lower voice, barely a whisper, she added:
'Have you forgiven me yet? I behaved very wickedly this
morning.'</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her brow as though she were
his wife. Then he stepped aside, for his tears were blinding
him. The idea occurred to him that he might as well
prepare a sleeping-draught while waiting for the doctor's
arrival. Pauline's little medicine-chest was in a small cupboard
in the room. He felt a little afraid lest he should make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
some mistake, and he looked closely at the different phials;
finally he poured a few drops of morphia into a glass of
sugared water. When she swallowed a spoonful of it, the
pain in her throat became so great that he hesitated about
giving her a second. There was nothing else he could do.
That spell of inactive waiting was becoming terribly painful
to him. When he could no longer endure to stand beside her
bed and see her suffering, he turned to his books again,
hoping to find therein an account of her malady and its
remedy. Could it be a case of diphtheritic angina? He had
certainly not seen any malignant growth on the roof of her
mouth, but he plunged into the perusal of a description of
that complaint and its treatment, losing himself in a maze
of long sentences whose meaning he could not gather, and
striving to grope through superfluous details, like a child
battling with some lesson he cannot understand. By-and-by
a sigh brought him hurrying back to the bedside, with his
head buzzing with scientific terms, whose uncouth syllables
only served to increase his anxiety.</p>

<p>'Well, how is she getting on?' inquired Madame
Chanteau, who had come softly upstairs again.</p>

<p>'Oh! she keeps just the same,' Lazare replied.</p>

<p>Then, in a burst of impatience, he added:</p>

<p>'It is terrible, this delay on the Doctor's part! The girl
might die twenty times over!'</p>

<p>The doors had been left open, and Matthew, who slept
under the table in the kitchen, had also just come up the
stairs, for it was his habit to follow people into every room of
the house. His big paws pattered over the floor like old
woollen slippers. He seemed quite gay at all this commotion
in the middle of the night, and wanted to jump up to Pauline,
and even tried to wheel round after his tail, like an animal
unconscious of his master's trouble. But Lazare, irritated
by his inopportune gaiety, gave him a kick.</p>

<p>'Be off with you, or I'll choke you! Can't you understand,
you idiot?'</p>

<p>The dog, afraid of a beating, and, it may be, suddenly
grasping the situation, went to lie down under the bed. But
Lazare's rough behaviour had aroused Madame Chanteau's
indignation. Without waiting any longer she went down to
the kitchen again, saying drily: 'The water will be ready
whenever you want it.'</p>

<p>As she descended the stairs Lazare heard her muttering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
that it was abominable to kick an animal like that, and that
he would probably have kicked her also if she had remained
in the room. Every moment he went to the bedside to glance
at Pauline. She now seemed to be quite overcome with fever,
utterly prostrate; the only sign of life that came from her
was the wheezing of her breath amidst the mournful silence
of the room, a wheezing that began to sound like a death-rattle.
Then wild unreasoning fear again seized upon Lazare.
He felt quite certain that the girl would soon choke if help
did not arrive. He fidgeted about the room on tip-toes,
glancing perpetually at the timepiece. It was not three
o'clock, and Véronique could hardly have got to the Doctor's
yet. He followed her in imagination through the black night
all along the road to Arromanches. By this time she would
be passing the oak-wood; then she would cross the little
bridge, and then she would save five minutes by running
down the hill. At last a longing for tidings of some sort led
him to throw open the window, though it was quite impossible
for him to distinguish anything amidst the profound
darkness. Down in the depths of Bonneville only a single
light was gleaming, the lantern, probably, of some fisherman
preparing to put out to sea. Everything was wrapped in
mournful sadness, far-reaching abandonment, in which all life
appeared to die away. He closed the window and then opened
it again, only to close it quickly once more. He began to lose
all idea of the flight of time, and was startled when he heard
three o'clock strike. By this time the Doctor must have
got his horse harnessed, and his gig would be spinning along
the road, transpiercing the darkness with the yellow glare of
its lamp. Lazare grew so distracted with impatience as he
watched the sick girl's increasing suffocation that he started
up as from a dream, when, at about four o'clock, he finally
heard some rapid footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p>'Ah! here you are at last!' he cried.</p>

<p>Doctor Cazenove at once ordered a second candle to be
lighted, in order that he might examine Pauline properly.
Lazare held one of the candles, while Véronique, whose hair
the wind had thrown into wild disorder, and who was splashed
with mud to the waist, stood at the head of the bed with the
other. Madame Chanteau looked on. The sick girl was in
a state of semi-somnolence, and could not open her mouth
without a groan of pain. When the Doctor had laid her back
in bed again, he, who upon his first entrance had shown signs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
of great uneasiness, stepped into the middle of the room with
an expression of relief.</p>

<p>'That Véronique of yours put me into a pretty fright,'
said he. 'She told me such a lot of terrible things that I
thought the girl must have got poisoned, and you see that I
have come with my pockets crammed full of drugs.'</p>

<p>'It is angina, is it not?' Lazare asked.</p>

<p>'Yes, simple angina. There is no occasion for alarm at
present.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau indulged in a little gesture of triumph,
as much as to say that she had known that from the first.</p>

<p>'"No occasion for alarm at present"!' repeated Lazare,
his fears rising again. 'Are you afraid of complications?'</p>

<p>'No,' answered the Doctor, after some slight hesitation;
'but with these tiresome throat complaints one can never
feel quite sure of anything.'</p>

<p>He added that nothing more could be done just then, and
that he would prefer waiting till the morrow to bleed the
patient. But as the young man pressed him to attempt at
any rate some alleviating measures, he expressed his readiness
to apply some sinapisms. Véronique brought up a bowl
of warm water, and the Doctor himself placed the damped
mustard-leaves in position, slipping them along the girl's
legs from her ankles to her knees. But they only increased
her discomfort, for the fever continued unabated and her head
was still throbbing frightfully. Emollient gargles were also
suggested, and Madame Chanteau prepared a decoction of
nettle-leaves, which had to be laid aside, however, after a first
attempt to administer it, for pain rendered Pauline unable
to swallow. It was nearly six o'clock, and dawn was breaking
when the Doctor went away.</p>

<p>'I will come back about noon,' he said to Lazare on the
landing. 'Be quite easy. She is all right, except for the
pain.'</p>

<p>'And is the pain nothing?' cried the young man. 'One
never ought to suffer like that!'</p>

<p>Cazenove glanced at him, and then raised his hands to
heaven at such an extraordinary pretension.</p>

<p>When Lazare returned to Pauline's room, he sent his
mother and Véronique to get a little sleep. He himself
could not have slept if he had tried. He watched the day
breaking in that disorderly room: the mournful dawn it was
that follows a night of agony. With his brow pressed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
the window-pane, he was looking out hopelessly at the
gloomy sky, when a sudden noise made him turn. He
thought it was Pauline getting up in bed, but it was Matthew,
who had been forgotten by everybody, and who had at last
crept from under the bed to go to the girl, whose hand hung
down over the counterpane. And the dog began licking
that hand with such affectionate gentleness that Lazare,
quite touched at the sight, put his arm round his neck, and
said:</p>

<p>'Ah! my poor fellow, your mistress is ill, you see; but
she'll soon be all right, and then we'll all three go on our
rambles once more.'</p>

<p>Pauline had opened her eyes, and, though it pained her,
she smiled.</p>

<p>A period of suffering and sadness followed. Lazare, acting
upon an impulse of wild affection, almost refused to let the
others enter the sick-room. He would barely allow his mother
and Louise there in the morning to inquire after Pauline;
Véronique, in whom he now recognised a genuine affection for
his cousin, was the only one whose presence he tolerated. At
the outset of Pauline's illness Madame Chanteau tried to make
him understand the impropriety of a young man thus nursing
a girl; but he retorted by asking if he were not her husband,
and by saying that doctors attended women equally with men.
Between the young people themselves there was never the
slightest embarrassment. Suffering and, it might be, the
approach of death obliterated all other considerations. The
world ceased to have any existence for them. The chief
matters of interest were that the draughts should be taken
at the proper times, and such little details, whilst they waited
hour by hour for the illness to take a more favourable turn.
Thus minor matters of mere physical life suddenly assumed
enormous importance, as on them depended joy or sorrow.
The nights followed the days, and Lazare's existence seemed
to hang in the balance over a deep abyss into whose black
darkness he ever feared to fall.</p>

<p>Doctor Cazenove came to see Pauline each morning, and
sometimes called again in the evening after dinner. Upon
his second visit he had determined to bleed her freely. The
fever, however, though checked for a time, reappeared. Two
days passed, and the Doctor was evidently disturbed in his
mind, unable to understand the tenacity with which the
fever clung to his patient. As the girl felt ever-increasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
pain in opening her mouth, he could not make any proper
examination of the back of her throat, which seemed to him
to be much swollen and of a livid hue. At last, as Pauline
complained of increasing tightness, which made her throat
feel as though it would burst, the Doctor one morning
remarked to Lazare:</p>

<p>'I am beginning to suspect the presence of a phlegmon.'</p>

<p>The young man then drew him into his own room. The
previous evening, while turning over the pages of an old
Manual of Pathology, he had read the chapter on retro-pharyngeal
abscesses which project into the &#339;sophagus, and
are apt to cause death by suffocation from compressing the
windpipe.</p>

<p>He turned very pale as he asked:</p>

<p>'Then she is going to die?'</p>

<p>'I trust not,' the Doctor answered. 'We must wait and
see what happens.'</p>

<p>But Cazenove himself could not conceal his uneasiness.
He confessed that he was almost powerless in the present
circumstances of the case. How could they search for an
abscess at the back of a contracted mouth? And, besides,
to open the abscess too soon would be attended with grave
danger. The best thing they could do was to leave the
matter in the hands of Nature, though the illness would
probably prove very protracted and painful.</p>

<p>'Well, I am not the Divinity,' he exclaimed, when Lazare
reproached him with the uselessness of his science.</p>

<p>The affection which Doctor Cazenove felt for Pauline
showed itself in an increased assumption of brusque carelessness.
That tall old man, who seemed as dry as a branch
of brier, was really much affected. For more than thirty
years he had knocked about the world, changing from vessel
to vessel, and working in hospitals all over the colonies. He
had treated epidemics on board ship, frightful diseases in
tropical climes, elephantiasis at Cayenne, serpent bites in
India; and he had killed men of every colour; had studied
the effects of poison on Chinese, and risked the lives of
Negroes in delicate experiments in vivisection. But now
this girl, with a soreness in her throat, so wrought upon his
feelings that he could not sleep. His iron hands trembled,
and his callousness to death failed him, fearful as he was
of a fatal issue. And so, wishing to conceal an emotion
which he considered unworthy of him, he made a pretence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
contempt for suffering. 'People were born to suffer,' said he,
'so why make a fuss about it?'</p>

<p>Every morning Lazare said to him:</p>

<p>'Do try something else, Doctor, I beg you. It is terrible.
She cannot get a moment's rest. She has been crying out
all the night.'</p>

<p>'Well, but, dash it all, it isn't my fault!' the Doctor
replied, working himself up to a high pitch of indignation.
'I can't cut off her neck to cure her.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the young man grew vexed in his turn, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'So medicine is worth nothing?'</p>

<p>'Nothing at all when the human machine is out of order.
Quinine arrests fever, and purgatives act on the bowels, and
bleeding is useful in apoplexy, but it's a happy-go-lucky
business with almost everything else. We must leave the
case to Nature.'</p>

<p>These remarks were wrung from him by his anger at
being unable to discover what course of treatment to adopt.
It was not his ordinary custom to deny the power of medicine
so roundly, for he had practised it too much to be sceptical or
modest as to its merits. For whole hours he would sit by
the girl's bedside, watching her and studying her, and then
he would go off without even leaving a single instruction
behind him, for indeed he knew not what to do, and was
compelled to leave the abscess developing, though he
recognised that a hair's breadth more or less in its size might
make all the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>For a whole week Lazare gave himself up to the most
terrible alarm. He, too, was in perpetual fear of seeing
Nature's work suddenly cease. At every painful, difficult
gasp that the girl gave he thought that all was over. He
formed in his mind a vivid picture of the phlegmon, he
fancied he could see it blocking Pauline's windpipe; if it
were only to swell a little more her breath would no longer
be able to pass. His two years of imperfect medical study
served to increase his alarm. His fears made him lose his
head, and he broke out into nervous mutiny, excited protest
against life. Why was such frightful suffering permitted?
Was not all such bodily torture, all such writhing and burning
pain cruelly purposeless when disease fell on a poor weak
girl? He was for ever at her bedside, questioning her, even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
at the risk of fatiguing her. Was she still in pain? How
was she feeling now?</p>

<p>Sometimes he would take her hand and lay it upon his
neck. It felt like an intolerable weight there, like a ball of
molten lead, which throbbed till he almost choked. Her
headache never left her. She did not know where or how to
rest her head, and she was tortured by sleeplessness. During
the ten days that the fever racked her she scarcely slept for
a couple of hours. One evening, to make things still worse,
she experienced a frightful pain in her ears, and fainted from
sheer suffering. But she did not confess to Lazare all the
agony she endured. She showed great courage and fortitude,
recognising that he was almost as ill as she herself
was, his own blood hot with fever, and his throat choked as
by an abscess. She frequently even told fibs, and forced a
smile to her lips when racked by the keenest suffering. She
felt easier, she would say, and she would beg him to go and
take a little rest. One of the most painful features of her
illness was that she could not even swallow her saliva without
giving a cry, at which Lazare would start up in alarm,
and begin to question her afresh. What was the matter,
and where did she feel pain? Then, with her eyes closed,
and her face distorted by agony, she would try to deceive him
and whisper that it was a mere nothing, that something had
tickled her, and that was all.</p>

<p>'Go to sleep and don't be uneasy. I am going to sleep
myself now.'</p>

<p>Every evening she went through this pretence of going
to sleep, in order to induce him to lie down, but he persisted
in watching over her from his arm-chair. The nights were
so full of anguish that they never saw the evening fall without
a sort of superstitious terror. Would they ever see the
sun again?</p>

<p>One night Lazare was leaning against the bed, holding
Pauline's hand in his own, as he often did, to let her know
that he was there and was not deserting her. Doctor Cazenove
had gone off at ten o'clock, angrily exclaiming that he
could answer for nothing more. The young man derived
some consolation from the thought that Pauline herself was
not aware that she was in any imminent danger. In her
hearing, only a mere inflammation of the throat was spoken
of, which, though very painful, would pass away as easily as a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
cold in the head. The girl seemed quite tranquil as to the
outcome, and bravely retained a cheerful countenance in spite
of her sufferings. She smiled as she heard them forming
plans for the time when she would be well again. That very
night she had once more listened to Lazare arranging a stroll
along the shore for the first day that she might be able to
go out. Then they grew silent, and she seemed to sleep,
but after an interval of a quarter of an hour or so she said
distinctly:</p>

<p>'You will have to marry some other girl, I think, my
dear.'</p>

<p>He stared at her in amazement, feeling chilled to his
bones.</p>

<p>'Why do you say that?' he asked.</p>

<p>She had opened her eyes, and was looking at him with an
expression of brave resignation.</p>

<p>'Ah! I know what is the matter with me, and I am glad
that I do, for I shall be able to kiss you all before I go.'</p>

<p>Then Lazare grew quite angry. It was insane to think
such things. Before a week was over she would be walking
about. But he dropped her hand and made an excuse for
hurrying to his own room, for sobs were choking him;
and he threw himself down in the darkness upon his bed, on
which he had not slept for a long time now. A frightful
conviction suddenly wrung his heart. Pauline was going to
die, perhaps that very night. And the thought that she
knew it, and that her silence on the subject hitherto had
been due to courageous consideration for the feelings of
others, even in the imminent presence of death, completed
his despair. She knew the truth; she would see her death
agony approach, and he would be there powerless! Already
he saw them saying their last good-bye. The whole mournful
scene unfolded itself before his eyes with heart-rending detail
in the darkness of his room. It was the end of everything,
and he grasped his pillow in his arms convulsively, and
buried his head in it to drown the sound of his sobs.</p>

<p>The night, however, passed away without any misfortune.
Then two days went by without any noticeable change in the
patient's condition. Between her and Lazare a new bond had
sprung up; the thought of death was with them. Pauline
made no further allusion to her critical condition; she
even forced herself to look cheerful; and Lazare, too, succeeded
in feigning perfect tranquillity, complete confidence in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
seeing her leave her bed in a few days' time; yet both knew
that they were ever bidding each other good-bye in the long,
loving glances which their eyes exchanged. At night-time
especially, as Lazare sat watching by the girl's bedside,
they recognised that each other's thoughts were of that
threatened eternal separation which kept them so reflective
and silent. Never before had they experienced such melting
sadness or felt such a complete blending of their beings.</p>

<p>One morning, as the sun was rising, Lazare felt quite
astonished at the calmness with which he was able to contemplate
the idea of death. He ransacked his memory, and
he could only recall one occasion since the commencement of
Pauline's illness when he had felt a cold shudder at the
thought of ceasing to be. He had trembled, indeed, at the idea
of losing his companion; but that was another kind of fear,
into which no thought of the destruction of his own personality
entered. His heart bled within him, indeed, but it
seemed as though this combat which he was waging with
death put him upon an equality with the foe, and gave him
courage to look it calmly in the face. Perhaps, too, his
fatigue and anxiety filled him with a drowsiness and weariness
which numbed his personal fears. He closed his eyes so
that he might not see the rising sun, and tried to recall all
his old thrills of horror, by telling himself that he, too,
would have to die some day. But no reply came; all that
seemed to have become quite indifferent to him and to have
ceased to have any power to affect him. Even his pessimism
seemed to disappear in the presence of that sick-bed; and,
far from plunging him into hatred and contempt of the world,
his mutinous outburst against suffering was but a passionate
longing for robust health, a wild love of life. He no longer
talked of blowing the earth into bits, as a worn-out and
uninhabitable planet. The one image which ever haunted
his mind was Pauline, hearty once more and walking with
him arm in arm beneath the bright sunshine; the only
craving he felt was to lead her, gay and firm of step, along
the paths through which they had once rambled together.</p>

<p>Yet it was that same day that Lazare felt sure of death's
approach. At eight o'clock in the morning Pauline was
seized with attacks of nausea, and each brought on dangerous
symptoms of suffocation. Soon trembling fits supervened,
and the poor girl shook so terribly that her teeth could be
heard chattering. Lazare, in a state of frightful alarm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
shouted from the window that a lad should be sent to
Arromanches at once, although the doctor was expected, as
usual, at eleven o'clock. The house had fallen into mournful
silence, and there had been a sad void since Pauline's gay
activity had no longer animated it. Chanteau spent his days
downstairs in moody silence, with his eyes fixed on his legs,
fearing lest he should be seized with another attack of gout
while there was no one to nurse him. Madame Chanteau
usually forced Louise to go out, and the pair of them, spending
most of their time in the open air, had by this time
become very intimate and familiar. Only Véronique's heavy
step came and went everlastingly up and down the stairs,
breaking the silence of the landings and empty rooms.
Lazare had gone three times to lean over the banisters in
his impatience to learn whether the servant had been able to
get anybody to take a message to the doctor. He had just
returned to Pauline's room and was looking at the girl, who
appeared to be a little easier, when the door, which he had
left ajar, creaked slightly.</p>

<p>'Well, Véronique?' he said.</p>

<p>But it was not Véronique; it was his mother. She had
that day intended to take Louise to see some of her friends in
the neighbourhood of Verchemont.</p>

<p>'Little Cuche has just gone,' she said. 'He can run
fast.'</p>

<p>Then, after a short interval of silence, she asked:
'Is she no better?'</p>

<p>Lazare made no answer, but with a hopeless gesture
pointed to Pauline, who was lying motionless, as though she
were quite dead, with her pale face bathed in cold perspiration.</p>

<p>'Ah! we won't go to Verchemont, then,' his mother continued.
'It seems very tenacious, this mysterious illness
which no one seems to understand. The poor girl has been
sorely tried.'</p>

<p>She sat down and went on chattering in the same subdued
monotonous voice.</p>

<p>'We had meant to start at seven o'clock, but it happened
that Louise overslept herself. Everything seems to be falling
on one this morning; it almost looks as though it were
done on purpose. The grocer from Arromanches has just
called with his bill, and I have been obliged to pay him,
and now the baker is downstairs. We spent forty francs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
on bread again last month. I can't imagine where it all
goes to!'</p>

<p>Lazare was not paying the least attention to what she said;
he was too much absorbed in his fears of a return of the
shivering-fits. But that monotonous flood of talk irritated
him, and he tried to get his mother to leave the room.</p>

<p>'Will you give Véronique a couple of towels and tell her
to bring them up to me?' he said.</p>

<p>'Of course I shall have to pay the baker,' his mother
resumed, as though she had not heard him. 'He has spoken
to me, and so Véronique can't tell him that I have gone out.
Upon my word, I've had quite enough of this house. It is
becoming quite a burden. If Pauline were not unfortunately
so ill, she would advance me the ninety francs for her
board. It is the 20th to-day, so that there are only ten days
to wait before it will be due. The poor child seems so very
weak&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Lazare suddenly turned towards her.</p>

<p>'Well, what is it you want?' he asked.</p>

<p>'You don't happen to know where she keeps her money,
do you?'</p>

<p>'No!'</p>

<p>'I dare say it's in her chest of drawers. You might just
look.'</p>

<p>He refused with an angry gesture, and his hands
quivered.</p>

<p>'I beseech you, mother, for pity's sake, do go away.'</p>

<p>These last remarks had been hurriedly exchanged at the
far end of the room. There was a moment's painful silence,
which was broken by a clear voice speaking from the bed:</p>

<p>'Lazare, just come and take the key from under my pillow,
and give my aunt what she wants.'</p>

<p>They were both quite startled. Lazare began to protest,
for he was very unwilling to open the drawer; but he was
obliged to give way in order that he might not distress Pauline.
When he had given his mother a hundred-franc note, and had
slipped the key under Pauline's pillow again, he saw that the
girl was taken with another trembling-fit, which shook her
like a young aspen, and seemed likely to rend her in twain.
Two big tears trickled from her closed eyes and rolled down
her cheeks.</p>

<p>Doctor Cazenove did not arrive before his usual time. He
had seen nothing of little Cuche, who was probably larking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
about amongst the hedges. As soon as he heard what Lazare
had to say and cast a hasty glance at Pauline, he cried
out: 'She is saved!'</p>

<p>That sickness and those alarming fits of trembling were
simply indications that the abscess had at last broken. There
was no more occasion to fear suffocation; the complaint would
now gradually go off of itself. Their joy was great; Lazare
accompanied the Doctor out of the room; and as Martin, the
old sailor who had taken service with the Doctor, drank a
bumper of wine in the kitchen, everyone wanted to clink
glasses with him. Madame Chanteau and Louise drank some
walnut liqueur.</p>

<p>'I never felt really alarmed,' said the former. 'I was sure
there could be nothing serious the matter with her.'</p>

<p>'That didn't prevent the poor dear from having an awful
time of it!' exclaimed Véronique. 'I'm more pleased than if
some one had given me a hundred sous.'</p>

<p>Just at that moment Abbé Horteur came in. He had
called to make inquiries, and he drank a glass of wine by way
of doing like the rest. Every day he had come in this way
like a kindly neighbour; for, on his first visit, Lazare had
told him that he could not see the patient for fear of alarming
her, whereupon the priest had quietly replied that he understood
it, and had contented himself with mentioning the poor
girl's name when saying his masses. Chanteau, as he clinked
glasses with him, complimented him upon his spirit of
tolerance.</p>

<p>'Well, you see, she is coming round nicely, without the
help of an <i>Oremus</i>!'</p>

<p>'Everyone is saved after his own fashion,' the priest
declared sententiously, as he drained his glass.</p>

<p>When the Doctor had left, Louise wanted to go upstairs to
kiss Pauline. The poor girl was still suffering much pain,
but this was not now regarded as of much account. Lazare
gaily bade her take courage, and, quite dropping all pretence,
began even to exaggerate the danger through which she had
passed, telling her that three times already he had believed
that she was lying dead in his arms. Pauline, however,
manifested no exuberant delight at being saved; but she was
conscious of the joy of life, after having found the courage to
look calmly upon death's approach. An expression of loving
emotion passed over her worn, sad face as she pressed her
cousin's hand and murmured to him, smiling:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p>'Ah! my dear, you can't escape after all, you see. I shall
be your wife yet.'</p>

<p>Her convalescence was heralded in by long slumbers. She
slept for whole days, quite calmly, breathing easily and regularly,
steeped in a strength-restoring torpor. Minouche, who
had been banished from the room during her period of prostration,
took advantage of this quietness to slip in again. She
jumped lightly upon the bed, and immediately lay down
there, nestling beside her mistress. Indeed, she spent whole
days on it, revelling in the warmth of the blankets, or making
an interminable toilet, wearing away her fur by constant licking,
but performing each operation with such supple lightness
that Pauline could not even tell she was moving. At the
same time Matthew, who, equally with Minouche, was now
granted free access to the room, snored like a human being
on the carpet by the side of the bed.</p>

<p>One of Pauline's first fancies was to have her young friends
from the village brought up to her room on the following
Saturday. They had just begun to allow her to eat boiled
eggs after the very spare diet to which she had been subjected
for three weeks. Though she was still very weak, she
was able to sit up to receive the children. Lazare had to
go to the drawer again to find her some five-franc pieces.
After she had questioned her pensioners and had insisted on
paying off what she called her arrears, she became so
thoroughly exhausted that she lay back in a fainting condition.
But she manifested great interest in the piles, groynes, and
stockades, and every day inquired if they still remained firmly
in position. Some of the timbers had already weakened, and
her cousin told a falsehood when he asserted that only the
nailing of a plank or two had ceased to hold. One morning,
when she was alone, she slipped out of bed, wishing to see the
high tide dash against the stockades in the distance; and
this time again her budding strength failed her, and she
would have fallen to the ground if Véronique had not come
into the room in time to catch her in her arms.</p>

<p>'Ah! you naughty girl! I shall have to fasten you down
in bed if you don't behave more sensibly!' said Lazare with
a smile.</p>

<p>He still persisted in watching over her, but he was completely
worn out with fatigue, and would drop asleep in his
arm-chair. At first he had felt a lively joy in seeing her
drink her broth. The young girl's restored health became a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
source of exquisite pleasure to him; it was a renewal of life
of which he himself partook. But afterwards, when he had
grown accustomed to it, and all the girl's suffering had
passed away, he ceased to rejoice as over some unhoped-for
blessing. All that was left to him was a sort of hebetation,
a slackening of the nerves now that the struggle was over,
a confused notion that the hollowness and mockery of everything
was becoming manifest again.</p>

<p>One night when he had been sleeping soundly Pauline
heard him awake with a sigh of agony. By the feeble glimmer
of the night-light she caught a glimpse of his terror-stricken
face, his eyes staring wildly with horror, and his hands
clasped together in an attitude of entreaty. He stammered out
some incoherent words: 'O God! O God!'</p>

<p>She leant towards him with hasty anxiety, and called:
'What is the matter with you, Lazare? Are you in pain?'</p>

<p>The sound of her voice made him start. He had been
seen, then. He sat silent and vexed, and could only contrive
to tell a clumsy fib.</p>

<p>'There's nothing the matter with me. It was you yourself
who were crying out just now.'</p>

<p>But in reality the horror of death had just come back to
him in his sleep&mdash;a horror without cause, born of blank
nothingness&mdash;a horror whose icy breath had awakened him
with a great shudder. O God! he thought, so he would
have to die some day. And that thought took possession
of him, and choked him; while Pauline, who had laid her
head back again on her pillow, watched him with an air of
motherly compassion.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="V" id="V">V</a></h3>


<p>Every evening, in the dining-room, when Véronique had
cleared the table, Madame Chanteau and Louise chatted
together; while Chanteau, buried in his newspaper, gave brief
replies to his wife's few questions. During the fortnight
when he had thought Pauline in danger, Lazare had never
joined the family at dinner; but he now dined downstairs
again, though, directly the meal was over, he returned to his
post at the invalid's bedside. He scarcely closed the door
behind him before Madame Chanteau began with her old
complaints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>At first she affected loving anxiety.</p>

<p>'Poor boy!' she said, 'he is quite wearing himself out.
It is really foolish of him to go on endangering his health in
this way. He has scarcely had any sleep for the last three
weeks. He is paler than ever to-day.'</p>

<p>Then she would have a word or two of pity for Pauline.
The poor dear seemed to suffer so much that it was impossible
to stay in her room without a heartache. But she soon
began to harp upon the manner in which that illness upset
the house. Everything remained in a state of confusion;
their meals were always cold, and there was no relying upon
anything. Then she broke off suddenly, and, turning to her
husband, asked him:</p>

<p>'Has Véronique found time to give you your marshmallow
water?'</p>

<p>'Yes, yes,' he replied from behind his newspaper.
Then she lowered her voice and addressed herself to
Louise.</p>

<p>'It is very peculiar, but that poor Pauline seems to have
brought us nothing but misfortune. And yet some people
persist in looking upon her as our good angel! I know the
stories that are floating about. At Caen, they say&mdash;don't they,
Louise?&mdash;that we have grown quite rich through her. Rich,
indeed! I should just think so! You may speak to me quite
frankly, for I am above taking any notice of their slanderous
gossip.'</p>

<p>'Well, indeed, they do talk about you, just as they talk
about everybody else,' the girl murmured. 'Only last month
I was obliged to snub a notary's wife, who dared to speak on
the subject, without knowing anything at all about it. You
can't prevent people talking, you know.'</p>

<p>After that, Madame Chanteau made no attempt to veil her
real feelings. There was no doubt, she said, that they were
suffering from their own generosity. Had they wanted anyone's
assistance before Pauline came? And where would she
have been now, in what Paris slum, if they had not consented
to take her into their house? It was all very fine for people
to talk about her money, but that money had never been anything
but a source of trouble to them; indeed, it seemed to
have brought ruin with it. The facts spoke clearly enough
for themselves. Her son would never have launched out into
those idiotic speculations in seaweed, nor have wasted his
time in trying to prevent the sea from sweeping Bonneville<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
away, if that unlucky Pauline had not turned his head. If
she had lost her money, well, it was her own fault. The poor
young fellow had wrecked both his health and his future.
Madame Chanteau could hardly find words strong enough with
which to inveigh against those hundred and fifty thousand
francs of which her secrétaire still reeked. It was, indeed, all
the large sums which had been swallowed up, and the small
amounts which were still being daily abstracted and thus
increasing the deficit, that embittered her, as though therein
lay the ferment in which her honesty had rotted away. By
this time putrefaction was complete, and she hated Pauline
for all the money she owed her.</p>

<p>'What is the good of talking to such an obstinate
creature?' she resumed bitterly. 'She is horribly miserly at
heart, and, at the same time, she is recklessness itself. She
will toss twelve thousand francs to the bottom of the sea for
the Bonneville fishermen, who only laugh at us, and feed all
the filthy brats in the neighbourhood; while I perfectly
tremble, upon my word of honour I do, if I have to ask her
for only forty sous. What do you think of that? With
all her pretence of charity to others, she has got a heart of
stone.'</p>

<p>During all the talk of this kind Véronique was often in and
out of the room, clearing away the dinner things or bringing
in the tea, and she loitered to listen to what was being said,
and sometimes even ventured on a remark.</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle Pauline got a heart of stone! Oh, Madame!
how can you say so?'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau reduced her to silence by a stern look.
Then, resting her elbows on the table, she entered into a
series of complicated calculations, talking as to herself.</p>

<p>'I've nothing more to do with her money now, thank
goodness, but I should like to know how much of it there's
left. Not more than seventy thousand francs, I'll be bound.
Just let us reckon it up a little. Three thousand have gone
already in that experimental stockade; then there are, at
least, two hundred francs going every month in charity, and
ninety francs for her board here. All that mounts up quickly.
Will you take a bet, Louise, that she'll ruin herself? You
will see her reduced to a pallet one of these days. And when
she has quite ruined herself, who will take her in?&mdash;how will
she manage to live?'</p>

<p>At this Véronique could not restrain herself, but broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
out: 'I'm sure Madame could never think of turning her out
of doors?'</p>

<p>'What do you mean? What are you speaking about?'
her mistress demanded angrily. 'There's no question of
anyone being turned out of doors. I never turned anybody
out of doors. What I said was that nothing can be more
foolish, when one has had a fortune of one's own, to go
frittering it all away and becoming dependent upon other
people. Go off to your kitchen.'</p>

<p>The servant went off, grinding out muttered protests from
between her teeth. Then there came an interval of silence,
while Louise poured out the tea. The only sound in the room
was the slight rustling of the newspaper, which Chanteau
read from end to end, not missing even the advertisements.
Now and then he spoke a word or two to the young girl.</p>

<p>'You might give me another piece of sugar, please. Have
you had a letter from your father yet?'</p>

<p>'No, indeed,' she answered with a smile. 'But if I am in
the way I can leave at any time, you know. You have quite
sufficient trouble with Pauline's illness. I would rather have
gone away before, but you insisted upon my staying.'</p>

<p>'You mustn't talk like that,' he interrupted. 'It is only
too kind of you to give us the pleasure of your society till poor
Pauline can get downstairs again.'</p>

<p>'I can go to Arromanches till my father comes, if I am in
the way,' she continued, as though she had not heard him,
merely by way of teasing. 'My aunt Léonie has taken a
chalet there, and there are plenty of people there, and a good
beach where one can bathe at any rate. But she is very
wearisome is my aunt Léonie.'</p>

<p>Chanteau laughed at the girl's playful, fondling ways.
Though he dare not confess it to his wife, he was entirely on
the side of Pauline, who nursed him so kindly and carefully.
He buried himself in his newspaper again; while Madame
Chanteau, who had been immersed in deep reflections,
suddenly started up, as though awaking from a dream.</p>

<p>'There's one thing which I can't forgive her. She has
completely taken possession of my son. He scarcely stops at
the table for a quarter of an hour, and I can hardly get a
single word with him.'</p>

<p>'That will soon be over,' said Louise. 'She must have
someone with her.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau shook her head and tightened her lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
but the words which she seemed trying to keep back broke
out, apparently in spite of herself.</p>

<p>'It's all very well to say that, but it's a little peculiar for
a young man to be always shut up with a sick girl. There!
I've said what I mean and haven't kept it back, and if it
doesn't please others I can't help it.'</p>

<p>Then, noticing Louise's embarrassed look, she added:
'It isn't healthy to breathe the atmosphere of a sick-room.
She may easily infect him with her sore throat.
Those girls who seem so vigorous have sometimes all sorts
of impurities in their blood. Well, I don't know why I
shouldn't say it, but I don't think she is quite sound and
healthy.'</p>

<p>Louise then feebly defended her friend. She had always
found her so nice and kind; that was the only argument
which she contrived to bring forward&mdash;in reply to the
accusation of a stony heart and ill-health. An instinctive
desire for tranquil peace and quietness induced her to try to
mitigate Madame Chanteau's rough ill-feeling, although every
day she listened to her trying to excel her bitterness of the
day before. While making some kind of protest against the
harshness of Madame Chanteau's language, Louise indeed
flushed with secret pleasure at finding herself preferred to
Pauline, promoted to the position of favourite. She was like
Minouche in this respect, content to be caressing so long as
her own enjoyment was not interfered with.</p>

<p>Every evening the conversation, after flowing along the
same channels, ended invariably in the same way, Madame
Chanteau slowly saying:</p>

<p>'No, Louisette, the girl that my son ought to marry&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>And from that starting-point she would launch out into a
disquisition upon the qualities of an ideal daughter-in-law,
while her eyes all the time remained fixed upon Louise, trying
to make her understand more than she was willing to
actually say. It was the girl's own self that was gradually
being described. A young person who had been well brought
up and educated, who had acquired a knowledge of society,
and who was fit to play the part of a hostess, who was graceful
rather than beautiful, and, what was especially desirable,
who was truly feminine and lady-like; for a boy-like girl,
a hoyden who made frankness a pretence for being rough
and rude, was, said she, her detestation. Then there was
the question of money&mdash;which was really the only one that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
influenced her&mdash;and this she made a pretence of dismissing
with a word, saying that, though she made no account of a
dowry, her son had great schemes and aims for the future,
and could not, of course, afford to contract a marriage that
would be likely to lead to ruin.</p>

<p>'I may tell you, my dear, that if Pauline had come here
penniless, with nothing but the chemise she wore, the marriage
would probably have taken place years ago. But you
can't be surprised at my hesitation and distrust, when I see
money slipping through her hands like water. The sixty
thousand francs she still has left won't trouble her much
longer, I fancy. No! Lazare deserves a better fate than that,
and I will never consent to his marrying a mad creature who
would stint the house in food so that she might ruin herself
with idiotic follies.'</p>

<p>'Ah, no! money's nothing,' said Louise, lowering her eyes;
'still one needs some.'</p>

<p>Although Louise's dowry was not directly referred to, her
two hundred thousand francs seemed to be lying there upon
the table, glistening beneath the glow of the hanging lamp.
It was because Madame Chanteau felt and saw them there that
she became thus excited, and swept aside Pauline's paltry
sixty thousand in her dream of winning for her son that
other girl whose big fortune was still intact. She had noticed
how Lazare had been drawn towards Louise before all this
tiresome business, which now kept him in seclusion upstairs.
If the girl was equally attracted towards him, why shouldn't
they make a match of it? Her husband would give his
consent, and that the more readily when he saw it was a case
of mutual affection. Thus she did all she could to fan
Louise's love into life, spending the rest of the evening in
making such remarks as she thought likely to excite the girl's
passion.</p>

<p>'My Lazare is so good! No one knows half how good he
is. You yourself, Louisette, have no notion how affectionate
is his nature. Nobody will pity the girl who gets him for a
husband. She will be quite certain of being passionately
loved. And he is such a handsome vigorous fellow, too! His
skin is as white as a chicken's. My grandfather, the Chevalier
de la Vignière, had such a white skin that he used to wear his
clothes cut quite low like a woman's when he went to masked
balls.'</p>

<p>Louise blushed and smiled, and was much amused with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Madame Chanteau's details. The mother's advocacy of her
son, and the confidences which she poured out to Louise with
the object of inclining her to a union with Lazare, might have
kept her there all night if Chanteau had not begun to feel very
drowsy over his newspaper.</p>

<p>'Isn't it about time for us all to go to bed?' he asked
with a yawn.</p>

<p>Then, as though he had been quite unconscious for
some time of what had been going on, and was taking up
the thread of Madame Chanteau's earlier conversation, he
added:</p>

<p>'You are quite mistaken. She is a good girl, and I shall
be very glad when she is able to come downstairs again and
eat her soup beside me.'</p>

<p>'We shall all be glad,' cried his wife, with considerable
bitterness. 'We may speak and say what we think, without
ceasing to be fond of those of whom we talk.'</p>

<p>'The poor little dear!' exclaimed Louise, in her turn; 'I
should be very glad to bear half the pain for her, if such a
thing were possible. She is so amiable!'</p>

<p>Véronique, who was just bringing them their candles, once
more put in her word.</p>

<p>'You are quite right to be her friend, Mademoiselle Louise,
for no one, unless she had a paving-stone for a heart, could
ever wish her unkindly.'</p>

<p>'That will do,' said Madame Chanteau. 'We didn't ask
for your opinion. It would be very much better if you cleaned
the candlesticks. This one here is quite filthy.'</p>

<p>They all rose from their seats. Chanteau lost no time in
escaping from his wife's snappishness, and shut himself up in
his room on the ground floor. But when the two women
reached the landing upstairs, where their rooms adjoined each
other, they did not at once go to bed. Madame Chanteau
almost always took Louise into her own room for a little time
and there resumed her remarks about Lazare, showing the
girl one and another portrait of him, and even exhibiting
little memorials and souvenirs, such as a tooth which had
been extracted when he was quite young, or a look of the
pale hair of his infancy, or even some of his old clothes;
for instance, the bow he had worn at his first communion, or
his first pair of trousers.</p>

<p>'See!' she said, one night, 'these are some locks of his
hair. I have a number, cut at all stages of his life.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, when Louise got to bed she could not sleep for
thinking of the young man whom his mother was trying to
force on her.</p>

<p>Up above, Pauline's convalescence was progressing gradually.
Although the patient was now out of danger, she still
remained very feeble, worn out and exhausted by feverish
attacks which astonished the doctor. As Lazare said,
doctors were always being astonished. He himself was
growing more irritable every hour. The sudden lassitude
which had fallen upon him when the crisis was over seemed
to be turning into a kind of uneasy restlessness. Now that he
was no longer wrestling against death, he began to feel distressed
by the close atmosphere of the apartment and the
spoonfuls of physic which had to be administered at regular
hours, and all the other little duties of a sick-room, which
he had so enthusiastically taken upon himself at first.
Pauline was able to do without him now, and he sank
back into the boredom of an aimless empty existence&mdash;a
boredom which kept him fidgeting from chair to chair, with
his hands hanging listlessly by his side, or wandering about
the room, staring hopelessly at the walls, or deep in gloomy
abstraction in front of the window, looking out, but seeing
nothing.</p>

<p>'Lazare,' Pauline said to him one day, 'you must go out.
Véronique will be quite able to do everything.'</p>

<p>But he hotly refused. 'Couldn't she bear his presence
any longer,' he asked, 'that she wanted to send him away?
It would be very nice of him, wouldn't it, if he were to desert
her like that before she was quite strong again?'</p>

<p>But he grew calm as she gently explained to him:</p>

<p>'You wouldn't be deserting me by just going out to get a
little fresh air. Go out in the afternoon. We should be in
a pretty way if you were to fall ill too.'</p>

<p>Then, however, she unfortunately added:</p>

<p>'I have seen you yawning all the morning.'</p>

<p>'You've seen me yawning!' he cried. 'Say at once that
I have no heart! This is a nice way to thank me!'</p>

<p>The next morning Pauline was more diplomatic. She
pretended that she was very anxious that the construction of
the stockades should be proceeded with; the high winter
tides were coming on, and the experimental works would be
swept away if the system of defence was not completed.
But Lazare no longer glowed with his early enthusiasm;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
he was dissatisfied with the resistance of the timbers as he
had arranged them, and fresh study would be necessary. Then,
too, the estimate would be exceeded, and the authorities had
not yet voted a single sou. For two days Pauline tried to fan
his inventive <i>amour-propre</i> into fresh life. She asked him if
he was going to let himself be beaten by the sea, with all the
neighbourhood looking on and smiling; as for the money, it
would certainly be paid back, if she advanced it, as they had
settled she should. By degrees Lazare then seemed to work
himself up to his old pitch of enthusiasm. He made fresh
designs and again called in the carpenter from Arromanches,
and had long consultations with him in his own room, the
door of which he left open so that he might be ready to go
to Pauline at the first summons.</p>

<p>'Now,' said he one morning as he kissed the girl, 'the
sea won't be able to break anything. I am quite sure we
shall be successful. As soon as you are able to walk, you
must go and see how the works are getting on.'</p>

<p>Louise had just come up into the room to inquire after
Pauline's health, and as she, too, kissed her, the patient
whispered to her:</p>

<p>'Take him away with you.'</p>

<p>Lazare at first refused to go. He was expecting the
doctor, he said. But Louise laughed and told him that she
was sure he was much too gallant to let her go alone to the
Gonins, where she was going to choose some lobsters to
send to Caen. Besides, he could give a look at the works on
the way.</p>

<p>'Yes, do go,' said Pauline. 'It will please me if you do.
Take his arm, Louise. There, now, don't let him get away
again.'</p>

<p>She grew quite merry as the two others jokingly pushed
each other about; but when they had left the room she
became very thoughtful, and leaned over the edge of her bed
to listen to their laughter and footsteps dying away down
the stairs.</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Véronique came in with the
doctor. By-and-by she installed herself at Pauline's bedside,
but without abandoning her saucepans, for she kept perpetually
running to and fro between the kitchen and the
bedroom, spending an hour or so there, as she was able, in
the intervals of her work. She did not, however, take
over all the duties of nurse at once. Lazare came back in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
the evening after going out with Louise, but he set off again
the next morning; and each succeeding day, carried away
as he was, absorbed more and more in outdoor life, his visits
to Pauline grew shorter and shorter, till he soon stayed only
long enough to inquire after her. Pauline, too, always told
him to run off, if he merely spoke of sitting down; and when
he and Louise returned together she made them tell her all
about their walk, and grew quite bright amidst their animation
and the touch of the fresh breezes which still seemed to
cling to their hair. They seemed such good friends, and
nothing else, that all her old suspicions of them had vanished.
And when she saw Véronique coming towards her, with her
draught in her hand, she cried out to her gaily:</p>

<p>'Oh! be off! You worry me!'</p>

<p>Sometimes she called Lazare to her to tell him to look
after Louise, as though she had been a child.</p>

<p>'See that she doesn't get bored. She wants amusing.
Take her for a good long walk; I shall get on very well
without you for the rest of the day.'</p>

<p>When she was left alone, her eyes seemed to be following
them from a distance. She spent her time in reading,
waiting till she should be strong again, for she was still so
weak that it quite exhausted her to sit up for two or three
hours in an easy-chair. She would often let her book slip
on to her lap, while her thoughts dreamily wandered off after
her cousin and her friend. She wondered whether they
were walking along the beach, and had got to the caves,
where it was so pleasant on the sands amidst the fresh
breezes and rising tide. In those long reveries she fancied
that the feeling of sorrow which depressed her came merely
from the fact that she was unable to be with them. She
soon grew weary of reading. The novels which lay about the
house, love-stories abounding in romantic falsity and treason,
had always offended her sense of honour, for she felt how
impossible it would be, after once giving her heart, to withdraw
it again. Was it true, then, that people's hearts
could lie so, and that, after having once loved, they could
ever cease to love? She threw the books from her in
disgust; and with her wandering gaze saw, in imagination,
her cousin bringing her friend home, he supporting her
weary steps, as they came along side by side, whispering
and laughing.</p>

<p>'Here is your draught, Mademoiselle,' suddenly said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
Véronique, whose deep voice, coming from behind, aroused
Pauline from her reverie with a start.</p>

<p>By the end of the first week Lazare never came to her
room without first knocking. One morning as he opened
the door he caught sight of her, combing her hair as she sat
up in bed, with her arms bare.</p>

<p>'Oh! I beg your pardon!' he cried, stepping back.</p>

<p>'What's the matter?' said she. 'Are you frightened of
me?' Then he took courage, but he was afraid lest he
should embarrass her, and turned his head aside until she
had finished fastening up her hair.</p>

<p>A fortnight before, when he had thought that she was
dying, he had lifted her in his arms as though she had been
a child, without even noticing her nakedness. But now the
very disorder of the room disquieted him. And the girl
herself, catching his feeling of uneasiness, soon refrained
from asking of him any of the little services that he had
lately been accustomed to render her.</p>

<p>'Shut the door, Véronique!' she cried one morning, as
she heard the young man's step on the landing. 'Put all
those things out of sight and give me that fichu.'</p>

<p>She was gradually growing stronger, and her great
pleasure, when she was able to stand up and lean against the
window, was to watch the progress that was being made with
the defensive works. She could distinctly hear the blows of
the hammers, and see the gang of seven or eight men, who
bustled about like big ants over the yellowish shingle on
the beach. Between the tides they worked away energetically,
but they were obliged to retire before the rising water.
It was with special interest, too, that Pauline's eyes followed
Lazare's white jacket and Louise's pink gown, both of which
glittered conspicuously in the sun. She followed them constantly
with her gaze, and could have told their every action,
almost their every gesture, throughout the day. Now that
the operations were being pushed so vigorously forward they
could no longer wander off together, or ramble to the caves
inside the cliffs; and thus Pauline constantly had them
within half a mile of her, always plainly visible beneath the
wide expanse of sky, though their stature was reduced by
distance to that of dolls. Quite unknown to herself, this
jealous pleasure of accompanying them in fancy did much
to cheer her convalescence and recruit her strength.</p>

<p>'It amuses you, eh, to watch the workmen?' Véronique<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
used to repeat every day as she dusted the room. 'Well, it's
much better for you than reading. Whenever I try to read
I get a headache. And, besides, when one wants to get back
strength, one must go and open one's mouth in the sunshine
like the turkeys do, and drink in great mouthfuls of it.'</p>

<p>Véronique was not naturally of a talkative nature; she
was even considered a little morose and taciturn; but with
Pauline she chatted freely from a friendly impulse, believing
that she did the girl good.</p>

<p>'It's a funny piece of business all the same! But it seems
to please Monsieur Lazare. Though, indeed, he does not
appear to be quite so full of it just now as he was. But he
is so proud and obstinate that he will go on persisting in a
thing, even if he is really sick to death of it. And if he just
leaves those drunken fellows for a minute, they drive the
nails in all crooked.'</p>

<p>After she had swept the floor under the bed she added:</p>

<p>'And as for the duchess&mdash;'</p>

<p>Pauline, who was scarcely listening to the woman, caught
this word with surprise.</p>

<p>'The duchess? Whom are you talking of?'</p>

<p>'Mademoiselle Louise, of course! Wouldn't anyone say
that she had sprung straight from Jupiter's thigh? If you
were to go and look in her room and see all her little pots
and pomades and scents&mdash;&mdash;Why, as soon as ever you open
the door, it all catches you at the throat, the place smells so!
But she can't match you in good looks, for all that!'</p>

<p>'Oh, nonsense! I'm a mere country girl,' Pauline said
with a smile; 'Louise is very graceful and refined.'</p>

<p>'Well, she may be all that; but she hasn't got a pretty
face, all the same. I have had a good look at her when she
has been washing herself; and I know that, if I were a man,
I shouldn't be long in making up my mind between you.'</p>

<p>Carried off by her feeling of enthusiastic conviction, she
came and leaned against the window, close to Pauline.</p>

<p>'Just glance at her there on the beach! Doesn't she
look a mere shrimp? She is certainly a long way off, and
one can't expect her to appear as big as a church, but she
ought to show a figure of some sort! Ah! there's Monsieur
Lazare lifting her up, so that she mayn't wet her pretty little
shoes. She can't weigh very much in his arms, that's
certain! But there are some men who seem to prefer
bones!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p>Véronique checked herself suddenly, as she felt Pauline
quivering by her side. She was ever harping on this subject,
as if she itched to talk of it. All that she heard and all that
she saw&mdash;the conversations in the evening when Pauline was
calumniated, the furtive smiles of Lazare and Louise, and the
utter ingratitude of the whole family, which was rapidly growing
into treason&mdash;stuck in her throat and made her choke.
If she had gone up to the sick girl's room at the times when
her honest heart glowed with a sense of some fresh injustice,
she could not have restrained herself from revealing everything
to Pauline, but her fear of making her ill kept her
stamping about her kitchen, knocking her pots and pans
about, and swearing that she could not go on much longer in
that way, but would soon be driven into telling them all very
roundly what she thought about them. However, when she
got upstairs into Pauline's room, and a word that might vex
or disturb the girl escaped her lips, she tried to recall it or
explain it away with a touching awkwardness.</p>

<p>'But, thank goodness, Monsieur Lazare isn't the kind to
fall in love with a bag of bones. He has been in Paris, and
knows what's what. He has too much good taste. Look! he
has set her on the ground again just as if he were throwing a
match away!'</p>

<p>Then Véronique, in fear of letting her tongue slip again,
began to flourish her feather brush once more; while Pauline,
buried in deep thought, watched till evening Louise's pink
gown and Lazare's white jacket both gleaming in the distance
amidst the dark forms of the workmen. When she was
beginning to feel fairly well again, Chanteau was seized with
another violent attack of the gout; and this induced the
young girl to come downstairs at once. The first time that
she left her room it was to go and sit by the sick man's bedside.
As Madame Chanteau said, very bitterly, the house was
becoming quite a hospital. For some time her husband had
not left his chair. After repeated seizures his whole body
was now attacked by his foe; the disease mounted from his
feet to his knees, and then to his elbows and hands. The
little white pearl on his ear had fallen away, but others, of
larger size, had appeared. All his joints became swollen, and
spots of chalky tophus showed whitely, like lobster's eyes,
through his skin in all parts. It was from chronic gout that
he now suffered, chronic and incurable; the kind of gout
which stiffens and deforms the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>

<p>'Good heavens! what agony I'm in!' Chanteau kept
repeating. 'My left knee is as stiff as a log; I can't move
either my foot or my knee; and my elbow burns as though it
were on fire. Just look at it!'</p>

<p>Pauline looked, and observed an inflamed swelling on his
left elbow. He complained bitterly of the agony he was
suffering there; indeed, it very soon became unendurable.
He kept his arm stiffly stretched, as he sighed and groaned,
with his eyes constantly fixed upon his hand, which was a
pitiable sight, with all the finger-joints knotted and swollen,
and the thumb warped as though it had been beaten with a
hammer.</p>

<p>'I cannot keep like this. You must come and help me to
move. I thought just now that I had got myself fairly comfortable,
but I am as bad again as ever I was. It is just
as though my bones were being scraped with a saw. Try to
raise me a little.'</p>

<p>Twenty times in an hour did he have to be helped to
change his position. He was in a continual state of anxious
restlessness, always hoping to find relief in some new change.
But Pauline still felt too weak to venture to move him without
assistance.</p>

<p>'Véronique,' she would say softly, 'take hold of him very
gently and help me to move him.'</p>

<p>'No, no! not Véronique!' Chanteau would cry out, 'she
shakes me so!'</p>

<p>Then Pauline was obliged to make the effort herself, and
her shoulders gave way under the strain. And, however
gently she turned him round, he groaned and screamed so
terribly that Véronique rushed hastily out of the room. She
said that one needed to be a saint, like Mademoiselle Pauline,
to be able to do such work, for the good God Himself would
run away if He were to hear her master bellowing.</p>

<p>The paroxysms, however, became less acute, though they
did not cease, but recurred frequently both day and night,
keeping the sick man in a state of perpetual exasperation. It
was no longer merely in his feet that he felt as though sharp
teeth were gnawing at him, his whole body seemed bruised,
as though it were being crushed beneath a millstone. It was
impossible to afford him any relief; all that Pauline could do
was to remain by his side and yield submissively to his
caprices, ever changing his position for him, though without
succeeding in giving him any lasting ease. The worst of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
the matter was that pain made him unjust and violent, and
he spoke to her harshly, as though she were a very clumsy
servant.</p>

<p>'Oh, stop! stop! you are as awkward as Véronique!
Can't you manage it without digging your fingers into my
body like that? Your hands are as clumsy as a gendarme's.
Go away and leave me alone. I don't want you to touch me
any more.'</p>

<p>But Pauline, without a word of self-defence, showing a submissive
resignation nothing could ruffle, resumed her efforts
with increased gentleness. When she imagined he was getting
irritated with her she would conceal herself for a moment
behind the curtains, hoping that his anger would cool when
he no longer saw her. And often she would give way to
silent tears in her hiding-place, not for the poor man's harshness
towards her, but for the frightful martyrdom which made
him so hasty and violent. She listened to him as he talked
to himself amidst his sighing and groaning.</p>

<p>'She has gone away, the heartless girl! Ah! if I were to
die, there would only be Minouche left to close my eyes. It is
abominable to desert a human being in this way! I'll be
bound she's gone off to the kitchen to have some broth!'</p>

<p>Then, after a little wrestling and struggling, he groaned
more loudly, and ended by calling: 'Pauline, are you there?
Come and raise me a little. I can't get easy as I am. Shall
we try how the left side will do&mdash;shall we?'</p>

<p>Every now and then he would be suddenly seized with
deep regret, and would beg the girl's pardon for having treated
her unkindly. Sometimes he would tell her to fetch Matthew,
for the sake of having another companion, fancying that the
dog's presence would somehow or other alleviate his pain.
But it was in Minouche rather than in Matthew that he found
a faithful associate, for the cat revelled in the close, warm
atmosphere of sick rooms, and spent her days lying on a couch
near the bed. However, when the patient gave a more than
usually loud cry she seemed surprised, and turned upon him,
sitting on her tail, and staring at him with her big round
eyes, in which glistened the indignant astonishment of a
sober philosophic nature whose tranquillity had been deeply
disturbed. What could possess him to make all that disagreeable
and useless noise?</p>

<p>Every time that Pauline went out of the room with Doctor
Cazenove she preferred the same request.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>'Can't you inject a little morphia? It makes my heart
bleed to hear him.'</p>

<p>But the doctor refused. It would do no good; the paroxysms
would return again with increased violence. Since
the salicylic treatment appeared only to have aggravated the
disease, he preferred not to try any other drug. He spoke,
however, of seeing what a milk diet might do as soon as the
violence of the attack was over. Until then the patient was
to keep to the most sparing diet and diuretic drinks, and
nothing else.</p>

<p>'The truth is,' said Cazenove, 'that your uncle is a
gourmand who is now paying dearly for all his fine dishes.
He has been eating game; I know he has, for I saw the
feathers in the yard. It will be much the worse for him in
the end. I have warned him over and over again that the
reason of his suffering is that, instead of denying himself
such things, he prefers to yield to his appetite and take the
consequences. But you yourself will act still more foolishly,
my dear, if you over-exert yourself and make yourself ill
again. Do be careful! You will, won't you? Your health
still requires looking after.'</p>

<p>But she looked after it very little; she devoted herself to
her uncle entirely, and all notion of time and even of life itself
seemed to depart from her during the long days and nights
that she passed by his bedside, with her ears buzzing with the
groans and cries which ever filled the room. Her devotion
and self-sacrifice were so complete that she actually forgot all
about Louise and Lazare. She just exchanged a few words
with them now and then, when she ran across them as she
passed through the dining-room. By this time the work on
the shore was finished, and heavy rains had kept the
young people in the house for a week past; and, when the
idea that they were together once suddenly occurred to
Pauline, she felt quite happy to know that they were near
her.</p>

<p>Never before had Madame Chanteau appeared so busy.
She was taking advantage, she said, of the confusion into
which her husband's illness threw the household to go
through her papers, make up her accounts, and clear off
arrears of correspondence. So in the afternoons she shut
herself up in her bedroom, leaving Louise to her own
resources; and the girl immediately went upstairs to Lazare,
for she detested being alone. They thus got into the way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
being together, remaining undisturbed till dinner-time in the
big room on the second floor, that room which had so long
served Pauline both for study and amusement. The young
man's little iron bedstead was still there, hidden away behind
the screen. The piano was covered with dust, and the table
buried beneath an accumulation of papers, books, and pamphlets.
In the middle of it, between two piles of dry seaweed,
was a little model of a stockade, cut out of deal with
a knife, and recalling the grandfather's masterpiece, the
bridge which, in its glass case, adorned the mantelpiece in
the dining-room.</p>

<p>For some time Lazare had been falling into a nervous
condition. His workmen had irritated him, and he had just
rid himself of the works on the shore as of a burden beyond
his strength, without tasting the pleasure of seeing his
work accomplished. Other plans now filled his head&mdash;vague
projects for the future, appointments at Caen, operations
which would bring him great fame. Yet he never took any
definite active steps, but relapsed into a state of idleness
which seemed to render him weaker, less courageous, every
hour. The great shock which he had received from Pauline's
illness added to mental disquietude a perpetual craving for
the open air, a peculiar physical longing, as though he
felt some imperious necessity of recouping himself after his
struggle against pain and sorrow. The presence of Louise
still further excited his feverishness. She did not seem able
to speak to him without leaning upon his shoulder; she
smiled close to his face, and her cat-like graces, the warmth
that came from her person, and all the disturbing freedom
of her manner quite turned his head. He was seized with a
feeling against which his conscience struggled. With a friend
of his childhood, in his mother's house, any idea of the sort,
he told himself, was not to be thought of for a moment; and
his sense of honour made his arms tingle with pain whenever
he caught hold of Louise as they played together, and a thrill
sent his blood surging through his veins. It was no thought
of Pauline that kept him back. She would never have known
anything about the matter. Amidst all his strange fancies
he began to indulge in ferocious, pessimistic sallies respecting
women and love. Every evil originated in women, who were,
said he, foolish and fickle, and perpetuated grief by desire;
while love was nothing but delusion, the onslaught of future
generations which wished to come into existence. He thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
retailed all Schopenhauer's views, over which the blushing
girl grew very merry.</p>

<p>By degrees Lazare became more deeply enamoured of her,
genuine passion arose from amidst his disdainful prejudices,
and he threw himself into that fresh love with all his early
enthusiasm, which was still straining after a happiness that
ever seemed to evade him.</p>

<p>On Louise's side there had long been nothing but every-day
coquetry. She delighted in receiving attentions and
compliments, and flirting with pleasant men; and when one
of them ceased to appear interested in her she seemed quite
melancholy and out of her element. If Lazare neglected her
for a moment or two, to write a letter, or to plunge into one
of his sudden apparently groundless fits of melancholy, she
felt so unhappy that she began to tease and provoke him,
preferring danger to neglect. Later on, however, she experienced
some alarm as she felt the young man's burning
breath fanning her neck like a flame. But though aware of
the danger, she seemed unable to change her ways.</p>

<p>On the day when Chanteau's attack reached its worst
point the whole house shook with his bellowing: prolonged
heart-rending plaints, like the death-cries of a beast in the
hands of the slaughterer. After breakfast, of which she had
hastily partaken in a state of nervous irritation, Madame
Chanteau rushed from the room, saying:</p>

<p>'I can't endure it any longer; I shall begin to scream
myself if I stop here. If anyone wants me, I shall be in my
own room writing. And you, Lazare, take Louise upstairs with
you and try to amuse her, for the poor girl is not having a
very gay time here.'</p>

<p>They heard her bang her door on the first floor, while her
son and the girl climbed to the one above.</p>

<p>Pauline had gone back to her uncle. She, in her pity for so
much suffering, was the only one who retained her calmness.
If she could do nothing but just sit with him, she wished, at
any rate, to afford the poor man whatever comfort could be
derived from not being left to suffer in solitude. She fancied
that he bore up more bravely against his pain when she
looked at him, even if she did not speak a single word. For
hours she would sit in this way by his bedside, and the gaze
of her big compassionate eyes indeed soothed him somewhat.
But that day, with his head hanging over the bolster, his
arm stretched out, and his elbow racked with agony, he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
not even recognise her, and screamed yet more loudly whenever
she approached him.</p>

<p>About four o'clock Pauline, in a state of desperation,
went into the kitchen to speak to Véronique, leaving the door
open behind her, as she intended returning immediately.</p>

<p>'Something must really be done,' she said. 'I should
like to try some cold compresses. The doctor says they are
dangerous, though they are successful sometimes. Can you
give me some linen?'</p>

<p>Véronique was in a frightfully bad temper.</p>

<p>'Linen? I've just been upstairs to get some dusters, and
a nice reception I got! I had no business to come disturbing
them up there! Oh, it's a nice state of things!'</p>

<p>'But you might ask Lazare for some,' Pauline continued,
without yet understanding Véronique's remarks.</p>

<p>Then the servant, carried away by her anger, set her arms
a-kimbo, and, without taking time to think of what she was
saying, burst out: 'Yes, I should think so, indeed! They
are much too busy gallivanting up there!'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' the girl stammered, growing very
pale.</p>

<p>Véronique, alarmed at what she had said, attempted to
recall those words which she had so long been keeping to
herself. She tried to think of some explanation, some fib to
tell Pauline, but she could hit upon nothing that seemed of
any service. By way of precaution she had grasped the girl's
wrists, but Pauline freed herself with a sudden jerk, and
bounded wildly up the staircase, so choked, so convulsed by
anger that Véronique dared not follow her, trembling as she
did with fear at the sight of that pallid face, which she could
scarcely recognise. The house seemed to be asleep; the
upper floors were wrapped in silence, and nothing but
Chanteau's yell came from below to disturb the perfect
quietude. The girl sprang with a bound to the landing
of the first floor, where she jostled against her aunt, who
stood there, like a sentinel, barring any further advance.
She had probably been keeping guard in this way for some
little time.</p>

<p>'Where are you going?' she asked.</p>

<p>Pauline, still choking with emotion, and exasperated at
this hindrance to her progress, could not at first answer.</p>

<p>'Let me pass!' she at last managed to stammer, making
on angry gesture, before which Madame Chanteau quailed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
Then, with another bound she rushed up to the second floor,
while her aunt, rooted to the spot, threw up her arms, but
spoke no word. Pauline was possessed by one of those stormy
fits of rebellion which broke out amidst all the gentle gaiety
of her nature, and which, even when she was a mere child,
had afterwards left her in a prostrate fainting condition.
For some years past she believed that she had cured herself
of them. But an impulse of jealousy had just thrilled her so
violently that she could not have restrained herself without
shattering herself entirely.</p>

<p>When she reached Lazare's door on the top floor, she
threw herself against it. The key was bent by her impetuous
onset, and the door clattered back against the wall. And the
sight she then beheld brought her indignation to a climax.
Lazare was clasping Louise in his arms against the wardrobe
and raining kisses on her chin and neck, she passive,
half-fainting, unable to resist his embrace. They had begun,
no doubt, in mere sport, but the sport seemed likely to have a
disastrous ending. At Pauline's appearance there was a
moment of stupefaction. They all three looked at each other.
Then, at last, Pauline burst out:</p>

<p>'Oh! you hussy! you hussy!'</p>

<p>It was the girl's treason that angered her more than anything.
With a scornful gesture she pushed Lazare aside, as
though he were a child of whose pitiful weakness she was
well aware. But this girl, her own familiar friend, had
stolen her husband from her while she was busy nursing a
sick man down below! She caught her by the shoulders,
shook her, and was scarcely able to keep from striking her.</p>

<p>'What do you mean by this? Tell me! You have been
behaving infamously, shamelessly! Do you hear me?'</p>

<p>Then Louise, still in a state of stupor, and with her eyes
wandering vacantly, stammered:</p>

<p>'He held me; I could not get away.'</p>

<p>'He! Why, he would have burst into tears if you had
simply pushed him with your little finger!'</p>

<p>The sight of the room itself increased her anger&mdash;that
room where she and Lazare had loved each other, where she,
too, had felt her blood pulse more quickly through her veins
at the warm touch of the young man's breath. What should
she do to this girl to satisfy her vengeance?</p>

<p>Lazare, dazed, overcome with embarrassment, had just
resolved to attempt some interference, when Pauline dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
Louise from her so violently that the girl's shoulders struck
the wardrobe.</p>

<p>'Ah! I'm afraid of myself. Be off!'</p>

<p>And that was all she could now find to say. She chased
the other through the room, drove her out upon the landing
and down the staircase, crying after her perpetually:</p>

<p>'Be off! be off! Get your things together and be off!'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau was still standing on the landing of
the first floor. The rapidity of the scene had given her no
opportunity to interfere. But she now recovered her power of
speech and signed to Lazare to shut himself in his own room,
while she tried to soothe Pauline, pretending at first to be
very much surprised at what had happened. Meantime
Pauline, having driven Louise into her bedroom, still kept
on repeating:</p>

<p>'Be off! be off!'</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' her aunt asked her. 'Why is
she to be off? Are you losing your head?'</p>

<p>Then the young girl stammered out the whole story.
She was overcome with disgust. To her frank, honourable
nature such conduct appeared utterly shameless and incapable
of either excuse or pardon. The more she thought about it
the more indignant she felt, rebelling against it all in her
horror of deceit and her faithfulness of heart. When one
had once bestowed one's self, one could not withdraw the gift.</p>

<p>'Be off! Pack up your things at once and be off!' she
repeated.</p>

<p>Louise, completely overcome, unable to find a word to
say in her own defence, had already opened her drawers to
get her clothes together. But Madame Chanteau was growing
angry.</p>

<p>'Stay where you are, Louisette. Am I the mistress of
my own house? Who is it that presumes to give orders here
and allows herself to send my guests away? Such behaviour
is infamous! We are not living in a slum here!'</p>

<p>'Didn't you hear me, then?' cried Pauline. 'I caught
her up there with Lazare. He had her in his arms, and was
kissing her!'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau shrugged her shoulders. All her
stored-up bitterness broke out in words of base suspicion.</p>

<p>'They were only playing; where was the harm of it?
When he was nursing you in your room, did we ever
interfere?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p>The young girl's excitement suddenly subsided. She
stood quite motionless, pale, astounded at the accusation
which was thus launched against her. It was she who was
now being arraigned as guilty; her aunt appeared to suspect
her of disgraceful conduct.</p>

<p>'What do you mean?' she cried. 'If you had really
thought anything wrong you would not have allowed it for a
moment!'</p>

<p>'Well, you are not children! But I don't want my son to
lead a whole life of misconduct. And you had better leave
off harassing those who still remain honest women.'</p>

<p>For a moment Pauline continued silent, with her big
pure eyes fixed upon Madame Chanteau, who turned her own
away. Then she went up the stairs to her room, saying
curtly:</p>

<p>'Very well, it is I who will leave.'</p>

<p>Then silence fell again, a heavy silence, in which the
whole house seemed to collapse. Athwart that sudden
quietude Chanteau's groans suddenly rose once more like
those of an agonized deserted animal. They seemed to grow
louder and louder; they made themselves distinctly heard
till they drowned all other sound.</p>

<p>And now Madame Chanteau began to regret the words
which had escaped her. She recognised the irreparable
nature of the insult, and felt much disturbed in mind lest
Pauline should actually carry out her threat of immediate
departure. With such a girl everything was possible, and
what would people say of herself and her husband if their
ward should set off scouring the country and telling the
story of their rupture? Perhaps she would take refuge with
Doctor Cazenove, which would certainly give rise to a dreadful
scandal in the district. At the bottom of Madame
Chanteau's embarrassment there lurked a fear of the past;
of all the money which had been lost&mdash;a loss which might
suddenly be brought up against them.</p>

<p>'Don't cry, Louisette,' she said, feeling angry with Pauline
again. 'Here we are, in a bother again all through her
folly. She's always going on in this mad, violent way. It's
impossible to live quietly with her. But I will try to make
matters comfortable.'</p>

<p>'Oh no, let me go away, I beg you,' Louise cried. 'It
would be too painful for me to stop here. She is right; I
had better go.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p>'Not to-night, at any rate. I must see you safely to your
father's house. Just wait a moment, and I will go upstairs
and see if she is really packing her things.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau gently went upstairs and listened at
Pauline's door. She heard her walking hurriedly about the
room, opening and shutting her drawers. For a moment she
thought of entering, provoking an explanation, and bringing
the affair to an end with a flood of tears. But she was afraid;
she felt that she would stammer and blush before the girl,
and this feeling served to increase her hatred of her. So,
instead of knocking at the door, she went downstairs to the
kitchen, treading as silently as she could. An idea had just
occurred to her.</p>

<p>'Have you heard the row to which Mademoiselle Pauline
has just been treating us?' she asked Véronique, who had
begun furiously polishing her brass-ware.</p>

<p>The servant, with her head bent over the polish, made no
answer.</p>

<p>'She is getting quite unbearable! I can do nothing with
her. Would you believe that she is actually talking about
leaving us at once? She is packing her things at this
moment. I wish you would go upstairs and try to reason
with her.'</p>

<p>Then, as she still got no answer, she added:</p>

<p>'Are you deaf?'</p>

<p>'If I don't answer, it's because I don't choose,' Véronique
cried snappishly, bursting with angry excitement, and
rubbing a candlestick violently enough to hurt her fingers.
'She is quite right in going away. If I had been in her
place, I would have taken myself off long ago.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau listened with gaping lips, quite stupefied
by this mutinous outburst of loquacity.</p>

<p>'I'm not talkative,' Véronique continued, 'but you
mustn't press me too far or I shall let out all I think. I
should have liked to fling Mademoiselle Pauline into the sea
on the day you first brought her here as a little girl, but I
can't bear to see anyone ill-treated, and you have all of you
treated her so abominably that one of these days I shall give
anyone who hurts her a swinging box on the ears. You can
give me warning, if you like; I don't care a button; but I will
let her into some nice secrets. Yes, she shall know all about
how you have treated her, with all your fine pretences to
honour and honesty.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>'Hold your tongue! You are quite mad!' cried Madame
Chanteau, much disquieted by this fresh explosion.</p>

<p>'No, I will not hold my tongue! It is all too shameful!
Shameful, I say! Do you hear me? I have been choking
with it all for years and years! Wasn't it bad enough of
you to rob her of her money? Couldn't you have been
content with that, without tearing her poor little heart to
shreds? Oh yes! I know all about it; I have seen through
all your underhand plottings. Monsieur Lazare is perhaps
not quite so calculating as you are; but in other respects he's
not much better than you, for he wouldn't much mind giving
her her death-blow out of mere selfishness, just to save himself
from feeling bored! Ah, me! there are some people who
come into this world only to be preyed upon and devoured by
others.'</p>

<p>She flourished the candlestick about, and then caught
hold of a pan, which rumbled like a drum under the violent
rubbing she gave it. Madame Chanteau had been sorely
tempted to turn her out of the house at once, but she succeeded
in restraining herself and said to her icily:</p>

<p>'So you won't go up and speak to the girl? It would be
for her own good, to prevent her from committing a piece of
folly.'</p>

<p>Véronique became silent again, but at last she growled
out:</p>

<p>'I'll go up to her. Reason is reason, after all, and an
inconsiderate act never does any good.'</p>

<p>She stayed for a minute or two to wash her hands, and
then took off her dirty apron. When she opened the door
in the passage to make her way to the stairs a loud wail
rushed in. It was the ceaseless heart-rending wail of Chanteau.
Madame Chanteau, who was following Véronique,
thereupon seemed struck with an idea, and exclaimed in an
undertone, emphasising her words:</p>

<p>'Tell her that she can't think of leaving her uncle in the
dreadful state in which he is. Do you hear?'</p>

<p>'Well, he certainly is bellowing hard; there's no doubt
of that,' Véronique replied.</p>

<p>She went up the stairs, while her mistress, who had
stretched out her hand towards her husband's room, purposely
refrained from closing the door. The sick man's
groans ascended the staircase, increasing in volume at every
fresh storey. When Véronique reached Pauline's room she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
found her just on the point of leaving, having fastened up in
a bundle what little linen she would absolutely require, and
intending to send old Malivoire to fetch the rest in the
morning. She had calmed down again, and, though very
pale and low-spirited, was simply obeying the dictates of her
reason without any feeling of anger.</p>

<p>'Either she or I,' was the only answer she returned to all
that Véronique said, and she sedulously avoided mentioning
Louise's name.</p>

<p>When Véronique conveyed this reply to Madame Chanteau,
she found the latter in Louise's room, where the girl, having
dressed herself&mdash;for on her side she was determined to go
away&mdash;stood trembling, alarmed at the slightest creaking of
the door. Madame Chanteau was obliged to yield, and sent
to Verchemont for the baker's trap, saying that she would
take Louise to her Aunt Léonie at Arromanches. They
would invent some story to tell this lady; they would make
the violence of Chanteau's attack a pretext, alleging that his
screams had become quite unendurable.</p>

<p>After the departure of the two ladies, whom Lazare safely
seated in the baker's trap, Véronique shouted in the passage
at the top of her voice:</p>

<p>'You can come downstairs now, Mademoiselle Pauline;
there is nobody here.'</p>

<p>The house seemed empty; the heavy gloomy silence was
broken only by Chanteau's perpetual groans, which became
louder and louder. As Pauline came down the last step
Lazare, returning to the house from the yard, met her face
to face. His whole body shook with a nervous trembling;
he paused for a moment, as though anxious to confess his
fault and implore forgiveness, but a rush of tears choked his
voice, and he hurried up to his own room, without having
been able to say a word.</p>

<p>Chanteau was still lying with his head across the bolster
and his arm rigidly outstretched. He no longer dared make
the slightest movement; doubtless he had not even been
aware of Pauline's absence, as he lay there with his eyes
closed and his mouth open to yell and groan. None of the
sounds of the house reached him; and all he thought of was
to complain as long and as loudly as his breath would let
him. His cries grew more and more desperate, till they at
last seriously disturbed Minouche, who had had a family of
four kittens thrown away that morning, and who, already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
quite forgetful of them, had been purring lazily on an arm-chair.</p>

<p>When Pauline took her place again, her uncle howled so
loudly that the cat got up, unable to endure the din. She
fixed her eyes steadily on the sick man, with the indignation
of a well-behaved person whose serenity is disturbed. If she
could not be allowed to purr in peace, it would be impossible
for her to stop there. And she took herself off, with her tail
in the air.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="VI" id="VI">VI</a></h3>


<p>When Madame Chanteau returned home again in the evening,
a few minutes before dinner, no further mention was made of
Louise. She merely called to Véronique to come and take
her boots off. Her left foot was paining her.</p>

<p>'Little wonder of that!' the servant murmured. 'It's
quite swollen.'</p>

<p>The seams of the leather had indeed left crimson marks
on the soft white skin. Lazare, who had just come downstairs,
looked at his mother's foot and said:</p>

<p>'You have been walking too much.'</p>

<p>But she had really only walked through Arromanches.
Besides the pain in her foot, she that day experienced a
difficulty in breathing, such as had been increasingly affecting
her at intervals for some months past. Presently she began
to blame her boots for the pain she was enduring.</p>

<p>'Those tiresome bootmakers don't ever seem to make the
instep high enough! As soon as ever I get my boots on I'm
in a state of torture.'</p>

<p>However, as she felt no further pain after she had put on
her slippers, nothing more was thought of the matter. Next
morning the swelling had extended to her ankle, but by the
following night it disappeared altogether.</p>

<p>A week passed. From the very first dinner at which
Pauline had again found herself in the presence of Madame
Chanteau and Lazare they had all forced themselves to
resume their ordinary demeanour towards each other. No
allusion was made to what had occurred; everything seemed
to be just the same as usual. The family life went on in the
old mechanical way, with the same customary expressions of
affection, the same good-mornings and good-nights, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
same lifeless kisses given at fixed hours. A feeling of great
relief came, however, that they were at last able to wheel
Chanteau to his place at table. This time his knees had
remained stiff with ankylosis, and he could not stand upright.
But none the less he enjoyed his freedom from actual pain,
and was so entirely wrapped up in egotistical satisfaction at
his own well-being that he never gave a thought to the
joys or cares of the other members of the family. When
Madame Chanteau ventured to mention Louise's sudden
departure, he begged her not to speak to him of such melancholy
matters. Pauline, now freed from her attendance in
her uncle's room, tried to find some other means of occupying
herself, but she could not conceal the grief oppressing her.
She found the evenings especially painful, and her distress
was plainly visible despite all her affectation of calmness.
Ostensibly everything was just the same as usual, and the
old every-day routine was gone through; but every now and
then a nervous gesture or even a momentary pause would
make them all conscious of the hidden breach, the rift of
which they never spoke, but which was, all the same, always
widening.</p>

<p>At first Lazare had felt contempt for himself. The
moral superiority of Pauline, who was so upright and just,
had filled him with shame and vexation. Why had he
lacked the courage to go to her, confess his fault, and ask
her pardon? He might have told her the whole truth, how
he had suddenly been excited and carried away by the
presence of Louise, whose glamour had intoxicated him;
and his cousin was too generous and large-hearted not to
understand and make allowances. But insurmountable embarrassment
had kept him back; he felt afraid of cutting a still
more contemptible figure in the girl's eyes by entering upon
an explanation in which he would very likely stammer
and hesitate like a child. Beneath his hesitation, too,
there lurked the fear of telling another falsehood, for
his thoughts were still full of Louise, her image was perpetually
haunting him. In spite of himself, his long walks
always seemed to lead him into the neighbourhood of
Arromanches. One evening he went right on to Aunt
Léonie's little house and prowled round it, hurriedly taking
flight as he heard a shutter move, all confusion at the
baseness he had contemplated. It was the sense of his own
unworthiness that doubled his feeling of shame in Pauline's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
presence; and he freely condemned himself, though he could
not quench his passion. The struggle was perpetually going
on within his mind, and never before had his natural irresolution
proved such a source of pain to him. He only had
sufficient honesty and strength of purpose left him to avoid
Pauline and thus escape the last dishonour of perjuring himself.
It was possible that he still loved his cousin, but the
alluring image of her friend was ever before him, blotting out
the past and barring the future.</p>

<p>Pauline, on her side, waited for his defence and apology.
In her first outburst of indignation she had sworn that she
would never forgive him. Then she had begun to suffer
secretly at finding that her forgiveness had not been asked.
Why did he keep silence, and seem so feverish and restless,
spending all his time out of doors, as though he were afraid
to find himself alone with her? She was quite ready to
listen to him and to forget everything, if only he would show
a little repentance. As the hoped-for explanation failed to
come, she racked her mind to find reasons for her cousin's
silence. Her own pride kept her from making the first
advance; and, as the days painfully and slowly passed, she
succeeded in conquering herself so far as to resume all her old
cheerful activity. But beneath that brave show of calmness
there lurked everlasting unhappiness, and in her own room
at night she burst into fits of tears, and had to stifle the
sound of her sobs by burying her head in her pillow. Nobody
spoke about the wedding, though it was evident that
they all thought of it. The autumn was coming on; what
was to be done? Nobody seemed to care to say anything
on the matter; they all avoided coming to a decision till they
should feel able to discuss it again.</p>

<p>It was about this time that Madame Chanteau completely
lost her head. She had always been excitable and restless,
but the dim causes which had undermined all her good principles
had now reached a period of great destructiveness.
Never before had she found herself so completely off her
balance, so nervously feverish as now. The necessity for
restraint exasperated her torment. She suffered from her
rageful longing for money, which grew stronger day by day
and ended by carrying off her reason and her heart. She was
continually attacking Pauline, whom she now began to blame
for Louise's departure, accusing her of it as of an act of
robbery that had despoiled her son. She felt an ever-open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
wound which would not close; the smallest trifles assumed
monstrous proportions; she remembered the slightest incidents
of the horrid scene; she could still hear Pauline crying, 'Be
off! Be off!' And she began to imagine that she herself was
being driven away, that all the joy and the fortune of the
family was being flung into the streets. At night-time, as she
rolled about in bed in a restless semi-somnolent state, she
even regretted that death had not freed them from that
accursed Pauline. Intricate schemes and calculations sprang
up in wild confusion in her brain, but she was never able to hit
upon any practicable means of getting rid of the girl.</p>

<p>At the same time a kind of reaction seemed to increase her
affection for her own son, and she worshipped him now almost
more than she had done when she had held him in her arms
as an infant and had possessed his undivided love. From
morning till night she followed him with her anxious eyes;
and when they were alone together she would throw her arms
around him and kiss him, and beg him not to distress himself.
She swore to him that everything should be put right, that
she would strangle those who opposed her rather than have
him unhappy. After a fortnight of this continual struggling,
her face had become as pale as wax, though she grew no
thinner. The swelling in her feet had twice appeared again,
and had then subsided.</p>

<p>One morning she rang for Véronique, to whom she showed
her legs, which had swollen to the thighs during the night.</p>

<p>'Just look at the state I'm in! Isn't it provoking? I
wanted to go out so much to-day, and now I shall be obliged
to stay in bed! Don't say anything about it for fear of
alarming Lazare.'</p>

<p>She did not seem to be at all alarmed herself. She merely
remarked that she felt a little tired, and the members of the
family simply supposed that she was suffering from a slight
attack of lumbago. As Lazare had gone off on one of his
rambles along the shore, and Pauline refrained from entering
her aunt's room, knowing that her presence there would be
unwelcome, the sick woman occupied herself by dinning
furious charges against her niece into the servant's ears. She
seemed to have lost all control of herself. The immobility to
which she was condemned and the palpitations of the heart
which stifled her at the slightest movement goaded her into
ever-increasing exasperation.</p>

<p>'What's she doing downstairs? Up to some fresh wickedness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
I'm sure! She'll never think of bringing me even a
glass of water, you'll see!'</p>

<p>'But, Madame,' urged Véronique, 'it is you who drive her
from you.'</p>

<p>'Ah! you don't know her! There never was such a
hypocrite as she is. Before other people she pretends to be
kind and generous, but there's nothing she wouldn't do or
say when your back's turned. Yes, my good girl, you were
the only one who saw things clearly on the day I first brought
her here. If she had never come, we shouldn't now be in the
state we are. She will prove the ruin of us all. Your master
has suffered all the agonies of the damned since she has been
in this house, and she has worried and distressed me till she
has quite undermined my health; while as for my son, she
made him lose his head entirely.'</p>

<p>'Oh, Madame! how can you say that when she is so kind
and good to you all?'</p>

<p>Right up to the evening Madame Chanteau thus unburdened
herself of her anger. She raved about everything, particularly
about the abominable way in which Louise had been
turned out of the house, though it was the money question
that aroused her greatest anger. When Véronique, after
dinner, was able to go down to the kitchen again she found
Pauline there, occupying herself by putting the crockery
away; and so the servant, in her turn, took the opportunity
of unburdening herself of the angry indignation which was
choking her.</p>

<p>'Ah! Mademoiselle, it is very good of you to bother about
their plates. If I were you, I should smash the whole lot
to bits!'</p>

<p>'What for?' the girl asked in astonishment.</p>

<p>'Because, whatever you were to do, you couldn't come up
to half of what they accuse you of!'</p>

<p>Then she broke out angrily, raking up everything from the
day of Pauline's arrival there.</p>

<p>'It would put God Almighty Himself into a rage to see
such things! She has drained your money away sou by
sou, and she has done it in the most shameless manner
imaginable. Upon my word, to hear her talk one would
suppose that it was she who had been keeping you. When
she had your money in her secrétaire she made ever so much
fuss about keeping it safe and untouched, but all that didn't
prevent her greedy hands from digging pretty big holes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
it. It's a nice piece of play-acting that she's been keeping
up all this time, contriving to make you pay for those salt
workshops and then keeping the pot boiling with what was
left! Ah! I daresay you don't know, but if it hadn't been
for you they would all have starved! She got into a pretty
flurry when the people in Paris began to worry her about
the accounts! Yes, indeed, you could have had her sent
right off to the assize court if you had liked. But that didn't
teach her any lesson; she's still robbing you, and she'll end
by stripping you of your very last copper. I daresay you
think I'm not speaking the truth, but I swear that I am! I
have seen it all with my eyes and heard it with my ears;
and I have too much respect for you, Mademoiselle, to
tell you the worst things, such as how she went on when
you were ill and she couldn't go rummaging in your chest
of drawers.'</p>

<p>Pauline listened without finding a single word with which
to interrupt the narrative. The thought that the family
were actually living upon her and rapaciously plundering
her had, indeed, frequently cast a gloom over her happiest
days. But she had always refused to allow her mind to
dwell on the subject; she had preferred to go on living in
ignorance and accusing herself secretly of avarice. To-day,
however, she had to hear the whole truth of the matter, and
Véronique's outspokenness seemed to make facts worse than
she had believed. At each fresh sentence the young girl's
memory awoke within her; she recalled old incidents, the
exact meaning of which she had not at the time understood,
and she now saw clearly through all Madame Chanteau's
machinations to get hold of her money. Whilst listening
she had slowly dropped upon a chair, as though suddenly
overcome with great fatigue, and an expression of grief and
pain appeared upon her lips.</p>

<p>'You are exaggerating!' she murmured.</p>

<p>'Exaggerating! I!' Véronique continued violently. 'It
isn't so much the money part of the business that makes me
so angry. But what I can't forgive her is for having taken
Monsieur Lazare from you after once having given him to
you. Oh yes! it was very nice of her to rob you of your
money and then to turn against you because you were no
longer rich enough, and Monsieur Lazare must needs marry
an heiress! Yes, indeed; what do you think of it? They
first pillage you, and then toss you aside because you are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
longer rich enough for them! No, Mademoiselle, I will not
give over! There is no need to tear people's hearts to shreds
after emptying their pockets. As you loved your cousin,
and it was his duty to pay you back with affection and
kindness, why, it was abominable of your aunt to steal him
from you! She did everything. I saw through it all! Yes,
every evening she excited the girl; she made her fall in love
with the young man by all her talk about him. As certainly
as that lamp is shining, it was she who threw them into
each other's arms. Bah! she would have been only too glad
to have seen them compelled to marry; and it isn't her fault
if that didn't take place. Try and defend her if you can,
she who trampled you under foot and caused you so much
grief, for you sob in the night like a Magdalene! I can hear
you from my room! I feel beside myself with all that cruelty
and injustice!'</p>

<p>'Don't say any more, I beseech you!' stammered Pauline,
whose courage failed her. 'You are giving me too great
pain.'</p>

<p>Big tears rolled down her cheeks. She felt quite conscious
that Véronique was only telling her the truth, and
her heart bled within her. All the past sprang up before
her eyes in lively reality, and she again saw Lazare pressing
Louise to his breast, while Madame Chanteau kept guard
on the landing. Ah, God! what had she done that everyone
should join in deceiving her, when she herself had kept
faith with all?</p>

<p>'I beg you, say no more! I am choking with it all!'</p>

<p>Then Véronique, seeing that she was painfully overcome,
contented herself with adding:</p>

<p>'Well, it's for your sake and not for hers that I don't go
on. She's been spitting out a string of abominations about
you ever since the morning. She quite exhausts my patience
and makes my blood boil when I hear her turning all the
kindnesses you've done her into evil. Yes, indeed! She
pretends that you have been the ruin of the family, and that
now you are killing her son! Go and listen at the door, if
you don't believe me!'</p>

<p>Then, as Pauline burst into a fit of sobbing, Véronique,
quite unnerved, flung her arms round her neck and kissed
her hair, saying:</p>

<p>'There, there, Mademoiselle, I'll say no more. But it's
only right that you should know. It's too shameful for you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
to be treated in such a way. But there, I won't say another
word, so don't take on so!'</p>

<p>They were silent for a time, while the servant raked out
the embers still burning in the grate, but she could not
refrain from growling:</p>

<p>'I know very well why she's swelling out! All her
wickedness has gathered in her knees!'</p>

<p>Pauline, who was looking intently at the tiled floor, her
mind upset and heavy with grief, raised her eyes and asked
Véronique what she meant. Had the swelling, then, come
back again? The servant showed some embarrassment, as
she had to break the promise of silence which she had given
to Madame Chanteau. Though she allowed herself full liberty
to judge her mistress, she still obeyed her orders. Now, however,
she was obliged to admit that her legs had again swollen
badly during the night, though Monsieur Lazare was not
to know it. While the servant gave details of Madame
Chanteau's condition the expression of Pauline's face
changed&mdash;depression gave place to anxiety. In spite of all
that she had just learned of the old lady's conduct, she was
painfully alarmed by the appearance of symptoms which she
knew betokened grave danger.</p>

<p>'But she mustn't be left alone like this!' she exclaimed,
springing up. 'She is in danger!'</p>

<p>'In danger, indeed?' cried Véronique, unfeelingly. 'She
doesn't at all look like it, and she certainly doesn't think so
herself, for she's far too busy befouling other folks and giving
herself airs in her bed like a Pasha. Besides, she's asleep
just now, and we must wait till to-morrow, which is just the
day when the Doctor always comes to Bonneville.'</p>

<p>The next day it was no longer possible to conceal from
Lazare his mother's condition. All night long had Pauline
listened, constantly awakened from brief dozes, and ever
believing that she heard groans ascending through the floor.
Then in the morning she fell into so deep a sleep that it was
only at nine o'clock she was roused by the slamming of
a door. When, after hastily dressing herself, she went downstairs
to make inquiries, she encountered Lazare on the
landing of the first floor. He had just left his mother's
room. The swelling was reaching her stomach, and
Véronique had come to the conclusion that the young man
must be warned.</p>

<p>'Well?' asked Pauline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>At first Lazare, who looked utterly upset, made no reply.
Yielding to a habit that had grown upon him, he grasped
his chin with his trembling fingers, and when at last he tried
to speak he could scarcely stammer:</p>

<p>'It is all over with her!'</p>

<p>He went upstairs to his own room with a dazed air.
Pauline followed him. When they reached that big room on
the second floor, which she had never entered since the day
she had surprised Louise there in her cousin's arms, Pauline
closed the door and tried to reassure the young man.</p>

<p>'You don't even know what is the matter with her. Wait
till the Doctor comes, at any rate, before you begin to alarm
yourself. She is very strong, and we may always hope for
the best.'</p>

<p>But he was possessed by a sudden presentiment, and repeated
obstinately:</p>

<p>'It is all over with her; all over.'</p>

<p>It was a perfectly unexpected blow, and quite overcame
him. When he had risen that morning, he had looked at the
sea, as he always did, yawning with boredom and complaining
of the idiotic emptiness of life. Then, his mother having
shown him her knees, the sight of her poor swollen limbs,
puffed out by &#339;dema, huge and pallid, looking already like
lifeless trunks, had thrilled him with panic-stricken tenderness.
It was always like this. At every moment fresh
trouble came. Even now, as he sat upon the edge of his big
table, trembling from head to foot, he did not dare to give the
name of the disease whose symptoms he had recognised.
He had ever been haunted by a dread of heart disease seizing
upon himself and his relations, for his two years of medical
study had not sufficed to show him that all diseases were
liable to lead to death. To be stricken at the heart, at the
very source of life, that to him seemed the all-terrible, pitiless
cause of death. And it was this death that his mother was
going to die, and which he himself would infallibly die also
in his own turn!</p>

<p>'Why should you distress yourself in this way?' Pauline
asked him. 'Plenty of dropsical people live for a very long
time. Don't you remember Madame Simonnot? She died
in the end of inflammation of the lungs.'</p>

<p>But Lazare only shook his head. He was not a child, to
be deceived in that manner. His feet went on swinging
to and fro, and he still continued trembling, while he kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
his eyes fixed persistently on the window. Then, for the
first time since their rupture, Pauline kissed him on the
brow in her old manner. They were together again, side by
side, in that big room, where they had grown up, and all
their feeling against one another had died away before the
great grief which was threatening them. The girl wiped the
tears from her eyes, but Lazare could not cry, and simply
went on repeating, mechanically, as it were: 'It is all over
with her; all over.'</p>

<p>When Doctor Cazenove called, about eleven o'clock, as he
generally did every week after his round through Bonneville,
he appeared very much astonished at finding Madame Chanteau
in bed. 'What was the matter with the dear lady?'
he asked. He even grew jocular, and declared that they were
quite turning the house into an ambulance. But when he had
examined and sounded the patient, he became more serious,
and, indeed, needed all his great experience to conceal the
fact that he was much alarmed.</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau herself had no idea of the gravity of
her condition.</p>

<p>'I hope you are going to get me out of this, Doctor,' she
said gaily. 'There's only one thing I'm frightened about,
and that is that this swelling may stifle me if it goes on
mounting higher and higher.'</p>

<p>'Oh! keep yourself easy about that,' he replied, smiling
in turn. 'It won't go any higher, and if it does we shall
know how to stop it.'</p>

<p>Lazare, who had come into the room after the Doctor's
examination, listened to him trembling, burning to take
him aside and question him, so that he might know the
worst.</p>

<p>'Now, my dear Madame,' Doctor Cazenove resumed,
'don't worry yourself. I will come and have a little chat
with you again to-morrow. Good-morning; I will write my
prescription downstairs.'</p>

<p>When they got down, Pauline prevented the Doctor and
Lazare from entering the dining-room, for in Chanteau's
presence nothing more serious than ordinary lumbago had
ever been mentioned. The girl had already put ink and
paper on the table in the kitchen. And, noticing their impatient
anxiety, Doctor Cazenove confessed that the case was
a grave one; but he spoke in long and involved sentences,
and avoided telling them anything definite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>'You mean that it is all over with her, eh?' Lazare cried
at last, in a kind of irritation. 'It's the heart, isn't it?'</p>

<p>Pauline gave the Doctor a glance full of entreaty, which
he understood.</p>

<p>'The heart? Well, I'm not quite so sure about that,' he
replied. 'But, at any rate, even if we can't quite cure her,
she may go on for a long time yet, with care.'</p>

<p>The young man shrugged his shoulders in the angry
fashion of a child who is not to be taken in by fine stories.
Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p>'And you never gave me any warning, Doctor, though
you attended her quite recently! These dreadful diseases
never come on all at once. Had you no idea of it?'</p>

<p>'Well, yes,' Cazenove murmured, 'I had indeed noticed
some faint indications.'</p>

<p>Then, as Lazare broke out into a sneering laugh, he
added:</p>

<p>'Listen to me, my fine fellow. I don't think that I'm a
greater fool than others, and yet this is not the first time
when it has happened to me to have had no inkling of what
was coming, and to find myself taken by surprise. It is
absurd of you to expect us to be able to know everything; it
is already a great deal to be able to spell out the first few
lines of what is going on in that intricate piece of mechanism&mdash;the
human body.'</p>

<p>He seemed vexed, and dashed his pen about angrily as he
wrote his prescription, tearing the thin paper provided for
him. The naval surgeon cropped up once more in the
brusque movements of his big frame. However, when he
stood up again, with his old face tanned brown with the sea
air, he softened as he saw both Pauline and Lazare hanging
their heads hopelessly in front of him.</p>

<p>'My poor children,' he said, 'we will try our best to bring
her round. You know that I never put on grand airs before
you. So I tell you frankly that I can say nothing. But it
seems to me that there is, at any rate, no immediate danger.'</p>

<p>Then he left the house, having ascertained that Lazare
had a supply of tincture of digitalis. The prescription simply
ordered some applications of this tincture to the patient's
legs, and a few drops of it to be taken in a glass of sugar and
water. This treatment, said the Doctor, would suffice for the
moment; he would bring some pills with him in the morning.
It was possible, too, that he might make up his mind to bleed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
her. Pauline went out with him to his gig in order to ask
him to tell her the real truth, but the real truth was that he
did not dare to say one thing or the other. When she returned
into the kitchen the girl found Lazare re-perusing the
prescription. The mere word digitalis had made him turn
pale once more.</p>

<p>'Don't distress yourself so much,' said Véronique, who
had begun to pare some potatoes, as an excuse for remaining
where they were and hearing what was said. 'The doctors
are all croakers. And surely there can't be much the matter
when they can't tell you what it is.'</p>

<p>They began to discuss the question round the bowl into
which the cook was cutting the potatoes, and Pauline appeared
to grow a little easier in her mind. She had gone that
morning to kiss her aunt, and had found her looking well.
A person with cheeks like hers could not surely be dying.
But Lazare went on twisting the prescription with his
feverish fingers. The word digitalis blazed before his eyes.
His mother was doomed.</p>

<p>'I am going up again,' he said at last.</p>

<p>As he reached the door he seemed to hesitate, and turned
to his cousin and asked:</p>

<p>'Won't you come, just for a minute?'</p>

<p>Pauline then seemed to hesitate in her turn, and finally
murmured:</p>

<p>'I'm afraid she mightn't be pleased if I did.'</p>

<p>And so, after a moment of silent embarrassment, Lazare
went upstairs by himself, without saying another word.</p>

<p>When Lazare, for fear lest his father should be disquieted
by his absence, appeared again at luncheon, he was very
pale. From time to time during the day a ring of the bell
summoned Véronique, who ran up with platefuls of soup,
which the patient could scarcely be induced to taste; and
when she came downstairs again she told Pauline that the
poor young man was growing perfectly distracted. It was
heart-breaking, she said, to see him shivering with fever
by his mother's bedside, wringing his hands and with his face
racked by grief, as though he every moment feared that he
should see her torn from him. About three o'clock, as the
servant came downstairs once more, she leant over the
balustrade and called to Pauline; and as the girl reached the
first-floor landing she said to her:</p>

<p>'You ought to go in, Mademoiselle, and help him a little.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
So much the worse if it displeases her. She wants Monsieur
Lazare to turn her round, and he can only groan, without
daring to touch her. And she won't let me go near her!'</p>

<p>Pauline entered the room. Madame Chanteau lay back,
propped up by three pillows, and, as far as mere appearances
went, if it had not been for the quick, distressful
breathing which set her shoulders heaving, she might have
been keeping her bed from sheer idleness. Lazare stood
before her, stammering:</p>

<p>'It's on your right side, then, that you want me to turn
you?'</p>

<p>'Yes; just turn me a little. Ah! my poor boy, how
difficult it seems to make you understand!'</p>

<p>But Pauline had already taken hold gently of her aunt
and turned her, saying:</p>

<p>'Let me do it! I am used to doing it for my uncle.
There! Are you comfortable now?'</p>

<p>But Madame Chanteau irritably exclaimed that they were
shaking her to pieces. She seemed unable to make the
slightest movement without being almost suffocated, and for
a moment, indeed, she lay panting, with her face quite livid.
Lazare had stepped behind the bed-curtains to conceal his
expression of despair; still, he remained present while Pauline
rubbed her aunt's legs with the tincture of digitalis. At first
he turned his head aside, but some fascination ever made his
eyes return to those swollen limbs, those inert masses of
pale flesh, the sight of which made him almost choke
with agony. When his cousin saw how utterly upset he
was she thought it safer to send him out of the room. She
went up to him, and, as Madame Chanteau dozed off, tired
out by the mere changing of her position, she whispered to
him softly:</p>

<p>'You would do better to go away.'</p>

<p>For a moment or two he resisted; his tears blinded him,
Then he yielded and went down, ashamed, and sobbing:</p>

<p>'Oh, God! God! I cannot endure it! I cannot endure
it!'</p>

<p>When the sick woman again awoke, she did not at first
notice her son's absence. She seemed to be in a state of
stupor, and as if egotistically seeking to make sure that
she was really alive. Pauline's presence alone appeared to
disquiet her, although the girl sat far away and neither
spoke nor moved. As her aunt bent forward, however, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
felt that she must just say a word to let her know why
Lazare was absent.</p>

<p>'It is I. Don't worry. Lazare has gone to Verchemont,
where he has to see the carpenter.'</p>

<p>'All right,' Madame Chanteau murmured.</p>

<p>'You are not so ill that he should neglect his business,
are you?'</p>

<p>'Oh! certainly not.'</p>

<p>From that moment she spoke but seldom of her son, notwithstanding
the adoration she had manifested for him only
the previous night. He became obliterated from the rest
of her life, after being so long the sole reason and object of
her existence. The softening of her brain, which was now
beginning, merely left her a physical anxiety about her own
health. She accepted her niece's care and attendance, without
apparently being conscious of the change, merely following
her constantly with her eyes, as though she were troubled
by increasing suspicions as she saw the girl pass to and fro
before the bed.</p>

<p>Lazare had gone down into the kitchen, where he remained
nerveless, beside himself. The whole house frightened
him. He could not stay in his own room, the emptiness of
which oppressed him, and he dared not cross the dining-room,
where the sight of his father, quietly reading a newspaper,
threw him into sobs. So it was to the kitchen that he
constantly betook himself, as being the one warm, cheerful
spot in the house&mdash;one where he was comforted by the sight
of Véronique, bustling about amongst her pans, as in the old
tranquil times. As she saw him seat himself near the
fireplace on a rush-bottomed chair, which he made his own,
she frankly told him what she thought of his lack of courage.</p>

<p>'It's not much use you are, Monsieur Lazare. It's poor
Mademoiselle Pauline who will have everything to do again.
Anyone would suppose, to see you, that there had never been
a sick woman in the house before, and yet, when your cousin
nearly died of her sore throat, you nursed her so attentively.
Yes, you know you did, and you stayed with her for a whole
fortnight helping her to change her position whenever it was
necessary.'</p>

<p>Lazare listened to Véronique with a feeling of surprise.
This inconsistency of his had not struck him before, and he
could not understand his own illogical and varying feelings
and thoughts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>'Yes; that is quite true,' he said, 'quite true.'</p>

<p>'You would not let anybody enter the room,' the servant
continued, 'and Mademoiselle was even a more distressing
sight than Madame is, her suffering was so great. Whenever
I came away from her room I felt completely upset, and
couldn't have eaten a mouthful of anything. But now the
mere sight of your mother in bed makes your heart faint.
You can't even take her a cup of gruel. Whatever your
mother may be, you ought to remember that she's still your
mother.'</p>

<p>Lazare no longer heard her; he was gazing before him
into space. At last he said:</p>

<p>'I can't help it; I really can't. It's perhaps because it
is my mother, but I can't do anything. When I see her and
those poor legs of hers, and think that she is dying, something
seems to be snapping inside me, and I should burst out
crying if I did not rush from the room.'</p>

<p>He began to tremble all over again. He had picked up
a knife which had fallen from the table, and gazed at it with
his tear-dimmed eyes without seeing it. For some time
neither spoke. Véronique busied herself over her soup,
which was cooking, to conceal the emotion which choked
her. At last she resumed:</p>

<p>'You had better go down to the beach for a little while,
Monsieur Lazare. You bother me by always being here in
my way. And take Matthew with you. He is very tiresome,
and no more knows what to do with himself than you do. I
have no end of trouble to keep him from going upstairs to
Madame's room.'</p>

<p>The next morning Doctor Cazenove was still doubtful. A
sudden catastrophe was possible, he said, or the patient might
recover for a longer or shorter time, if the swelling could be
reduced. He gave up the idea of bleeding her, and confined
himself to ordering her to take some pills which he brought,
and to continue the use of the tincture of digitalis. His air
of vexation showed that he felt little confidence in those
remedies in a case of organic disorder, when the successive
derangement of every organ renders a physician's skill of no
avail. However, he was able to assure them that the sick
woman suffered no pain; and, indeed, Madame Chanteau
made no complaint of actual suffering. Her legs felt as
heavy as lead, and she breathed with constantly increasing
difficulty whenever she moved; but, whilst she lay there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
quietly on her back, her voice remained so firm and strong,
and her eyes so bright and clear, that even she herself was
deceived as to the gravity of her condition. Her son was the
only one of those around her who did not venture to be hopeful
at seeing her looking so calm. When the Doctor went away
in his gig, he told them not to grieve too much, for that it
was a great mercy both for herself and for them that she was
quite unaware of her danger.</p>

<p>The first night had been a very hard one for Pauline.
Reclining in an easy chair, she had not been able to get any
sleep, for the heavy breathing of the sick woman constantly
filled her ears. Whenever she was on the point of dropping
off, her aunt's breath seemed to shake the house; and then,
when she opened her eyes again, she felt sad and oppressed;
all the troubles which had been marring her life for the last
few months sprang up in her mind with fresh force. Even
by the side of that death-bed she could not feel at peace, she
could not constrain herself to forgive. Amidst her nightmare-like
vigil during the mournful night hours Véronique's
assertions caused her great torture. Old outbursts of anger
and bitter jealousy surged up in her again, as she mentally
recapitulated the painful details. To be loved no more! To
find herself deceived, betrayed by those she had loved! And
to find herself all alone, full of contempt and revolt! Her
heart's wound opened and bled afresh, and never before had
she experienced such bitter pain from Lazare's insulting
faithlessness. Since they had, so to say, murdered her, it
mattered little to her now who died! And, amidst her
aunt's heavy breathing, she went on brooding ceaselessly
over the robbery of her money and her affections.</p>

<p>The next morning she still felt contrary influences at
work within her; she experienced no return of affection; it
was a sense of duty alone which kept her in her aunt's room.
The consciousness of this made her unhappy, and she
wondered if she too were growing as wicked as the others.
In this troubled state the day passed away, and, discontented
with herself, repelled by her aunt's suspicions, she forced
herself into attentive activity. Madame Chanteau received her
ministrations snappishly, and followed her movements with
suspicious eyes, carefully watching her every action. If she
asked her niece for a handkerchief, she always sniffed it before
using it, and when she saw the girl bring her a hot-water
bottle she wanted to examine the jug.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>'What's the matter with her?' Pauline whispered very
softly to Véronique. 'Does she think me capable of trying
to do her harm?'</p>

<p>When Véronique gave her a dose of her draught after
the Doctor had gone away, Madame Chanteau, not noticing
her niece, who was looking for some linen in the wardrobe,
inquired of the servant: 'Did the Doctor prepare
this?'</p>

<p>'No, Madame, it was Mademoiselle Pauline.'</p>

<p>Then the sick woman just sipped it with her lips, and
made a grimace.</p>

<p>'Ah! it tastes of copper. I don't know what she has
been making me take, but I've never had the taste of copper
out of my mouth since yesterday.'</p>

<p>And suddenly she tossed the spoon away behind the bed.
Véronique looked on in amazement.</p>

<p>'Whatever's the matter? What an idea to get into your
head!'</p>

<p>'I don't want to go away before my time,' replied
Madame Chanteau, as she laid her head back again upon her
pillow. 'Listen! my lungs are quite sound; and it's not
impossible that she may go before I do, for she isn't very
healthy.'</p>

<p>Pauline had heard her. She turned with a heart-pang
and looked at Véronique; and instead of coming any nearer
she stepped further away, feeling quite ashamed of her aunt
for her abominable suspicions. A sudden change came over
her feelings. The idea of that unhappy woman, consumed
by fear and hatred, moved her to the deepest pity; far from
feeling any increase of bitterness, it was sorrowful emotion
that she experienced as her eyes caught sight of all the medicine
which her aunt had thrown away under the bed, from
a fear of being poisoned. Until the evening she evinced
persevering gentleness, and did not appear to notice the
distrustful glances with which her aunt followed every motion
of her hands. Her one ardent desire was to overcome the
dying woman's fears by affectionate attentions, in order that
she might not carry such frightful suspicions to the grave.
And she forbade Véronique to distress Lazare further by
telling him the truth.</p>

<p>Only once since morning had Madame Chanteau asked for
her son, and she had appeared quite content with the first
excuse made for his absence, evincing no surprise at not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
seeing him again. She said nothing about her husband,
expressed no uneasiness whatever about his being left alone
in the dining-room. All the world was gradually disappearing
for her, and, minute by minute, the icy coldness of her
limbs seemed to mount higher till it chilled her very heart.
Whenever meal-time came round, Pauline had to go downstairs
and tell some fib to her uncle. In the evening she told
one to Lazare as well, assuring him that the swelling was
subsiding.</p>

<p>In the night, however, the disease made alarming progress,
and the next morning, soon after daybreak, when Pauline and
the servant beheld the sick woman they were terrified by the
wandering look in her eyes. Her face was not changed, and
there was no feverishness, but her mind appeared to be failing
her, a fixed idea seemed to be destroying her reason. She had
reached the last phase; her brain, gradually wrought upon
by a single absorbing passion, had now become a prey to
insanity.</p>

<p>That morning, before Doctor Cazenove's arrival, they had
a terrible time. Madame Chanteau would not even let her
niece come near her.</p>

<p>'Do let me nurse you, I beg you!' Pauline said. 'Just let
me raise you a little, as you are lying so uncomfortably.'</p>

<p>But her aunt began to struggle as though they were trying
to suffocate her.</p>

<p>'No, no! You have got a pair of scissors there! Ah!
you are sticking them into me! I can feel them! I can feel
them! I'm bleeding all over!'</p>

<p>The heart-broken girl was obliged to keep at a distance
from her aunt. She was quite overcome with fatigue and
distress, breaking down with her useless kindly endeavours.
She was obliged to put up with insults and accusations which
made her burst into tears before she could induce her aunt
to accept the slightest service from her. Sometimes all
her efforts were in vain, and she fell weeping upon a chair,
despairing of ever winning back again that affection of former
days, which was now replaced by insane animosity. Still she
would become all resignation once more, and strive to find
some way of making her assistance acceptable by manifesting
even greater care and tenderness. That morning, however,
her persistent entreaties ended by provoking a paroxysm
which long left her trembling.</p>

<p>'Aunt,' she said, as she was preparing a dose of medicine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
'it's time for you to take your draught. The Doctor, you
know, particularly said that you were to take it regularly.'</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau insisted upon seeing the bottle, and
then smelt its contents.</p>

<p>'Is it the same as I had yesterday?'</p>

<p>'Yes, aunt.'</p>

<p>'Then I won't have any of it!'</p>

<p>However, by much affectionate wheedling and entreaties,
her niece prevailed on her to take just one spoonful. The sick
woman's face wore an expression of deep suspicion, and no
sooner was the spoonful of physic in her mouth than she spat
it out again upon the floor, torn by a violent fit of coughing,
and screaming out between her hiccoughs:</p>

<p>'It's vitriol! It is burning me!'</p>

<p>Amidst this supreme paroxysm her hatred and terror of
Pauline, which had gradually increased ever since the day
when she had first abstracted a twenty-franc piece of the
other's money, now found vent in a flood of wild words, to
which the poor girl listened, quite thunderstruck, unable to
say a single syllable in her defence.</p>

<p>'Ah! you fancied I shouldn't detect it! You put verdigris
and vitriol into everything! It's that which is killing me!
There was nothing the matter with me, and I should have
been able to get up this morning if you hadn't mixed some
verdigris with my broth yesterday evening. Yes, you are tired
of me, and want to get me buried and done with. But I'm
very tough, and it is I who will bury you yet.'</p>

<p>Her speech became thicker, she choked, and her lips
turned so black that an immediate catastrophe seemed
probable.</p>

<p>'Oh! aunt, aunt!' cried Pauline, overcome with terror,
'you are making yourself so much worse by going on like
this!'</p>

<p>'Well, that's what you want, I'm sure! Oh! I know you.
You have been planning it for a long time; ever since you
have been here your only thought has been how to kill us off
and get hold of our money. You want to have the house for
your own, and I am in your way. Ah! hussy, I ought to
have choked you the first day you came here! I hate you!
I hate you!'</p>

<p>Pauline stood there motionless, weeping in silence. Only
one word rose to her lips, as though in involuntary protest
against her aunt's accusations. 'Oh God! God!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>But Madame Chanteau was completely exhausted by the
violence of her fury, and her mad outburst gave place to a
childish terror. She fell back on her pillow, crying:</p>

<p>'Don't come near me! Don't touch me! If you do I
shall scream out for help! No, no! I won't drink it; it's
poison!'</p>

<p>She pulled the bed-clothes over her with her twitching
hands, buried her head amongst the pillows, and kept her
mouth tightly closed. When her niece, who was terribly
alarmed, came to her bedside to try to calm her, she broke
out into frightful screams.</p>

<p>'Aunt dear, be reasonable. I won't make you take any
against your will.'</p>

<p>'Yes, you will! You've got the bottle! Oh! I'm
terrified! I'm terrified!'</p>

<p>She was almost at the last gasp; her head had got too low,
and purple blotches appeared upon her face. Pauline, imagining
that her aunt was dying, rang the bell for Véronique; and
it was as much as the two of them could do to raise her up
and lay her properly on her pillows.</p>

<p>Then Pauline's own personal sufferings and heartaches
disappeared amidst her intense grief. She thought no more
about the last wound which her heart had received; all
her passion and jealousy vanished in presence of that great
wretchedness. Every other feeling became lost in one of deep
pity, and she would have gladly endured injustice and insult
and have sacrificed herself still more if by so doing she could
only have given comfort and consolation to the others. She
set herself bravely to bear the principal share of life's woes;
and from that moment she never once gave way, but manifested
beside her aunt's death-bed all the quiet resignation
which she had shown when threatened by death herself. She
was always ready; she never recoiled from anything. Even
her old gentle affection came back to her; she forgave her
aunt for all her mad violence during her paroxysms, and wept
with pity at finding that she had gradually become insane;
forcing herself to think of her as she had been in earlier
years, loving her as she had done on that stormy evening when
she had first come with her to Bonneville.</p>

<p>That day Doctor Cazenove did not call till after luncheon.
An accident had detained him at Verchemont; a farmer there
had broken his arm, and the Doctor had stayed to set it.
After seeing Madame Chanteau he came down into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
kitchen, and made no attempt to conceal his alarm. Lazare
was sitting there by the fire, in that feverish idleness which
preyed upon him.</p>

<p>'There is no more hope, is there?' he asked. 'I was
reading Bouillaud's Treatise on the Diseases of the Heart
again last night.'</p>

<p>Pauline, who had come downstairs with the Doctor, once
more gave him an entreating look, which prompted him to
interrupt the young man in his usual brusque fashion.
Whenever an illness turned out badly, he always showed a
little anger.</p>

<p>'Ah! the heart, my good fellow, the heart seems to be the
only idea you have got! One can't be certain of anything.
For my own part, I believe it's rather the liver that is affected.
But, of course, when the machine gets out of order, everything
in turn is more or less affected&mdash;the lungs, the stomach,
and the heart itself. Instead of reading Bouillaud last night,
which has only upset you, you would have done much better
to go to sleep.'</p>

<p>This dictum of the Doctor's was like an order given to the
house. In Lazare's presence it was always said that his mother
was dying from a diseased liver; but he refused to believe
it, and spent his sleepless hours in turning over the pages of
his old books. He grew quite confused over the different
symptoms, and the remark made by the Doctor that the various
organs of the human body became successively deranged only
served to increase his alarm.</p>

<p>'Well,' he said with difficulty, 'how long, then, do you
think she will last?'</p>

<p>Cazenove made a gesture of doubt.</p>

<p>'A fortnight; perhaps a month. You had better not
question me, for I might make a mistake, and then you would
be right in saying that we know nothing and can do nothing.
But the progress that the disease has made since yesterday is
terrible.'</p>

<p>Véronique, who was washing some glasses, looked at him
in alarm. Could it really be true, then, that Madame was
so very ill and was going to die? Until then she had
been unable to believe there was any actual danger, and had
gone about her work muttering to herself of people who
tried to frighten folks out of pure malice. But she now
seemed stupefied, and when Pauline told her to go upstairs
to Madame Chanteau, that there might be some one with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
her, she wiped her hands on her apron and left the kitchen,
ejaculating:</p>

<p>'Oh, well, in that case&mdash;in that case&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>'We must not forget my uncle, Doctor,' said Pauline, who
seemed to be the only one who retained self-possession.
'Don't you think we ought to warn him? Will you see him
before you go?'</p>

<p>Just at that moment Abbé Horteur came in. He had only
heard that morning of what he called 'Madame Chanteau's
indisposition.' When he learned how seriously ill she really
was, an expression of genuine sorrow passed over his tanned
face, so cheerful a moment before as he came in from the
fresh air. The poor lady! Could it be possible? She who
had seemed so well and strong only three days ago!</p>

<p>Then after a moment's silence he asked if he could see
her; at the same time glancing anxiously at Lazare, whom
he knew to be little given to religion. On that account he
seemed to anticipate a refusal. But the young man, who
was quite broken down, did not appear to have noticed the
priest's question, and it was Pauline who answered it.</p>

<p>'No, not to-day, your reverence. She does not know the
danger she is in, and your presence might have an alarming
effect upon her. We will see to-morrow.'</p>

<p>'Very well,' the priest at once replied; 'there is no
great urgency, I hope. But we must all do our duty,
you know. And as the Doctor here refuses to believe in
God&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>For the last moment or two the Doctor had been gazing
earnestly at the table, absorbed in thought, lost in a maze
of doubt, as was always the case when he could not overcome
illness. He had just caught the Abbé's last words, however,
and he interrupted him, saying:</p>

<p>'Who told you that I didn't believe in God? God is not
an impossibility; one sees very strange things! And, after
all, who can be sure?'</p>

<p>Then he shook his head and roused himself from his
reverie.</p>

<p>'Stay!' he went on, 'you shall come with me and shake
hands with our good friend Monsieur Chanteau. He will
soon stand in need of all the courage he can muster.'</p>

<p>'If you think it will cheer him at all,' the priest obligingly
replied, 'I shall be glad to stay and play a few games of
draughts with him.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they both went off to the dining-room, while Pauline
hastened back to her aunt. Lazare, when he was left alone,
rose and hesitated for a moment as to whether he also should
not go upstairs; then he went to the dining-room door to
listen to his father's voice, without mustering enough courage
to enter; and finally he came back to the kitchen again, and
sank down upon the same chair as before, surrendering
himself to his despair.</p>

<p>The priest and the Doctor had found Chanteau rolling a
paper ball across the table&mdash;a ball formed of a prospectus
discovered inside a newspaper. Minouche, who was lying
near, looked on with her green eyes. She appeared to disdain
such an elementary plaything, for she had her paws stowed
away beneath her, never deigning to strike out at it with her
claws, though it had rolled close to her nose.</p>

<p>'Hallo! is it you?' cried Chanteau. 'It is very good of
you to come and see me. I'm very dull&mdash;all by myself. Well,
Doctor, she's getting on all right, I hope? Oh! I don't feel
at all uneasy about her; she's by far the strongest of all of us;
she will see us all buried.'</p>

<p>It occurred to the Doctor that this would be a good opportunity
for informing Chanteau of the real state of affairs.</p>

<p>'Well, certainly, there's nothing very alarming in her
condition, but she seems to me to be very weak.'</p>

<p>'Ah! Doctor,' Chanteau exclaimed, 'you don't know her.
She has an incredible fund of strength; you will see her on
her feet again in a day or two!'</p>

<p>In his complete belief in his wife's vigorous constitution,
he quite failed to understand the Doctor's hints; and the latter,
not wishing to tell him the dreadful truth in plain words,
could say no more. Besides, he thought that it would be as
well to wait a little longer; for just then Chanteau was free
from pain, his gout only troubling him in his legs, though
these were sufficiently incapacitated to make it necessary to
wheel him to bed in his chair.</p>

<p>'If it were not for these wretched legs of mine,' he said,
'I would go upstairs and see her myself.'</p>

<p>'Resign yourself, my friend,' said Abbé Horteur, who in
his turn now tried to carry out his office of consoler. 'We
each have our own cross to bear, and we are all in the hands
of God&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But he did not fail to notice that these words, so far from
consoling Chanteau, only appeared to bore and even disquiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
him, so he cut his exhortation short and substituted for it
something more efficacious.</p>

<p>'Would you like to have a game at draughts? It will do
you good.'</p>

<p>He went in person to take the draught-board from the cupboard.
Chanteau was delighted, and shook hands with the
Doctor, who then took his departure. The two others were
soon deep in their game, quite forgetful of all else in the world,
when all at once Minouche, who had probably got tired of
seeing the paper ball under her nose, sprang forward, sent it
spinning away, and bounded in wild antics after it all round
the room.</p>

<p>'What a capricious creature!' cried Chanteau, put out in
his play. 'She wouldn't have a game with me on any account
a little while ago, and now she prevents one from thinking by
playing all by herself.'</p>

<p>'Never mind her, said the priest mildly: 'cats have their
own way of amusing themselves.'</p>

<p>Meantime, passing through the kitchen, Doctor Cazenove
had experienced sudden emotion on seeing Lazare still
sorrowfully brooding on the same chair; and he caught the
young man in his big arms and kissed him paternally without
saying a word. Just at that moment Véronique came downstairs,
driving Matthew before her. The dog was perpetually
prowling about the staircase, making a sort of hissing sound,
which somewhat resembled the plaint of a bird; and, whenever
he found the door of the sick woman's room open, he
went in and there vented those sharp notes of his, which
were ear-piercing in their persistency.</p>

<p>'Get away with you, do! Be off!' the servant cried.
'That noise of yours isn't likely to do her any good.'</p>

<p>And as she caught sight of Lazare she added: 'Take him
for a walk somewhere. He will be out of our way, and it will
do you good too.'</p>

<p>It was really an order of Pauline's that Véronique was
conveying. The girl had told her to get Lazare to go out and
take some long walks. But he refused to go; it even seemed
to require an effort on his part to get upon his feet. However,
the dog came and stood before him, and began wailing
again.</p>

<p>'That poor Matthew isn't as young as he was once,' said
the Doctor, who was watching him.</p>

<p>'No indeed!' said Véronique. 'He is fourteen years old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
now, but that doesn't prevent him from being as wild as ever
after mice. Look how he has rubbed the skin off his nose,
and how red his eyes are! He scented a mouse under the
grate last night, and never closed his eyes afterwards; he
turned my kitchen upside down, poking about everywhere.
And such a great big dog, too, to worry about such tiny
creatures, it's quite ridiculous! But it isn't only mice that he
runs after. Anything that's little or crawls, newly hatched
chickens or Minouche's kittens, anything of that sort, excites
him to such a point that he even forgets to eat and drink.
Just now I'm sure he scents something out of the common in
the house&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She checked herself as she caught sight of Lazare's eyes
filling with tears.</p>

<p>'Go out for a walk, my lad,' the Doctor said to him.
'You can't be of any use here, and it will do you good to go
out a little.'</p>

<p>The young man at last rose painfully to his feet. 'Well,
we'll go,' he said. 'Come along, my poor old Matthew.'</p>

<p>When he had accompanied the Doctor to his gig, he set off
along the cliffs with the dog. From time to time he had to
stop and wait for Matthew, for the dog was really ageing
quickly. His hind-quarters were becoming paralysed, and his
heavy paws sounded like slippers as he dragged them along.
He was now unable to go scooping out holes in the kitchen-garden,
and quickly rolled over with dizziness when he set
himself spinning after his tail. He had fits of coughing, too,
whenever he plunged into the water, and after a quarter
of an hour's walk he wanted to lie down and snore. He
trudged along the beach just in front of his master's legs.</p>

<p>Lazare stood for a moment watching a fishing-smack
coming from Port-en-Bessin, with its sail skimming over the
sea like the wing of a gull. Then he went his way. The thought
that his mother was dying kept on thrilling him painfully;
if ever it left him for a moment, it was only to come back
and rack him more violently than before. And it brought
him perpetual surprise; it was an idea to which he could not
grow reconciled, and which prevented him from thinking
of anything else. If at times it lost distinctness he felt the
vague oppression of a nightmare, in which he remained
conscious of some great impending misfortune. Everything
around him then seemed to disappear, and when he again
beheld the sands and seaweed, the distant sea and far-reaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
horizon, he started as if they were all new and strange to him.
Could they be the objects that were so familiar to his eyes?
Everything seemed to have changed; never before had he thus
been struck by varying forms and hues. His mother was
dying! And he walked on and on, trying to escape from
that buzzing refrain which was ever sounding in his ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a deep sigh behind him. He turned
and saw the dog completely exhausted, with his tongue hanging
from his mouth.</p>

<p>'Ah! my poor old Matthew,' he said to him, 'you can't
get on any farther. Well, we'll go back again. However far
I may go, I shan't rid myself of my thoughts.'</p>

<p>That evening they hurried over dinner. Lazare, who
could only swallow a few mouthfuls of bread, hastened away
upstairs to his own room, excusing himself to his father by
alleging some pressing work. When he reached the first
floor, he went into his mother's room, where he forced himself
to sit for some five minutes before kissing her and wishing
her good-night. She seemed to be forgetting all about
him, and never expressed the least anxiety as to what he might
be doing during the day. When he bent over her, she offered
him her cheek and seemed to consider his hasty good-night
quite natural, absorbed as she was in the instinctive egotism
which attends the approach of death. And Pauline took care
to cut his visit as short as possible by inventing an excuse
for sending him out of the room.</p>

<p>But in his own big room on the second floor his mental
torment increased. It was in the night, the long weary night,
that his anguish weighed heaviest upon him. He took up a
supply of candles, so that he might never be without a light,
and he kept them burning, one after another, till morning,
terror-stricken by the thought of darkness. When he got into
bed he tried in vain to read. His old medical treatises were
the only books that had now any interest for him; but they
filled him with fear, and he ended by throwing them away.
Then he remained lying upon his back, with his eyes wide
open, solely conscious of the fact that close to him, on the
other side of the wall, there was an awful presence which
weighed upon him and suffocated him. His dying mother's
panting breath was for ever in his ears, that panting breath
which had become so loud that for the last two days he had
heard it whenever he climbed the staircase, which he never
ascended now without hastening his steps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole house seemed full of that plaint, which thrilled
him as he lay in bed; the occasional intervals of quiet inspiring
him with such alarm that he would run barefooted to the
landing and lean over the banisters to listen. Pauline and
Véronique, who kept watch together below, left the door of
the room open for the sake of ventilation, and Lazare could
see the pale patch of sleepy light which the night lamp threw
upon the tiled floor, and could again hear his mother's heavy
panting, which became louder and more prolonged in the
darkness. When he went back to bed he, too, left his door
open, and so intently did he listen to his mother's breathing
that even in the snatches of sleep into which he fell towards
morning he was still pursued by it. His personal horror of
death had vanished again as at the time of his cousin's illness.
His mother was going to die; everything was going to die!
He abandoned himself to the contemplation of that collapse
of life without any other feeling than one of exasperation at
his powerlessness to prevent it.</p>

<p>The next morning saw the commencement of Madame
Chanteau's death agony, a loquacious agony which lasted for
twenty-four hours. She was calm, the dread of poison no
longer terrified her, but she rambled on rapidly in a clear
voice, without raising her head from her pillow. What she
said was in no way conversation; she did not address herself
to anyone; it was as though, in the general derangement of
her faculties, her brain hastened to finish its work like a
clock running down. That flood of rapid words seemed to be
indeed the last tick-tack of the unwound chain of her mind.
The events of her past life defiled before her; but she never
said a word about the present, about her husband, or her son,
or her niece, or her home at Bonneville, where, with her
ambitious nature, she had suffered for ten long years. She
was still Mademoiselle de la Vignière, giving music-lessons in
the most distinguished families in Caen, and she familiarly
spoke of people whom neither Pauline nor Véronique had ever
heard of. She broke out into long rambling stories, whose
details were incomprehensible even to the servant who had
grown old in her service. She seemed to be emptying her brain
of the recollections of her youth before she died; just as one
may turn the faded letters of former days out of a desk in
which they have long been lying.</p>

<p>In spite of her courage, Pauline could not help shuddering
slightly as all those little involuntary confessions were poured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
out in the very throes of death. It was no longer difficult,
panting breathing that filled the room, but a weird, rambling
babble, of which Lazare caught fragments as he passed the
door. But, however much he might turn them over in his
mind, he was unable to understand them, and grew full of
alarm, as though his mother were already speaking from the
other side of the grave amidst invisible beings to whom she
was relating those strange stories.</p>

<p>When Doctor Cazenove arrived he found Chanteau and
Abbé Horteur playing draughts in the dining-room. From
all appearances, they might still have been engaged on the
game which they had commenced the day before, and have
never stirred from the room since the Doctor's previous visit.
Minouche sat near them, intently studying the draught-board.
The priest had arrived at an early hour to resume his duties
as consoler. Pauline no longer felt that his proposed visit to
her aunt would be attended with inconvenience; and so, when
the Doctor went upstairs to see her, the priest accompanied
him to the sick woman's bedside, presenting himself simply as
a friend anxious to know how she was getting on.</p>

<p>Madame Chanteau recognised them both, and, having been
raised up on her pillows, she smilingly welcomed them with
all the airs of a Caen lady holding a reception. The dear
Doctor was surely quite satisfied with her, she said; she
would soon be able to leave her bed. Then she questioned
the Abbé about his own health. The latter, who had come
upstairs with the intention of fulfilling his priestly duties,
was so overcome by the dying woman's rambling chatter that
he could not open his mouth; and, besides, Pauline, who was
in the room, would have stopped him if he had mentioned
certain subjects. The girl had sufficient control over herself
to feign confident cheerfulness. When the two men went
away, she accompanied them to the landing, where the Doctor,
in low tones, gave her instructions as to what she should do
at the last moment. Such words as 'rapid decomposition'
and 'carbolic acid' were frequently mentioned, while the
ceaseless chatter from the dying woman still buzzed through
the open doorway.</p>

<p>'You think, then, that she will see the day out?' the
girl inquired.</p>

<p>'Yes, I feel sure that she will live till to-morrow,' Cazenove
answered. 'But don't lift her up any more, or she might die
in your arms. I shall come again this evening.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p>It was settled that Abbé Horteur should remain with
Chanteau and gradually prepare him for the fatal issue.
Véronique stood listening near the door while this was being
agreed upon, and her face assumed a scared expression.
Ever since the probability of her mistress's death had become
clear to her she had scarcely opened her lips, but sought to
render all possible service with the silent devotion of a faithful
animal. But the conversation was hushed, for Lazare,
wandering over the house, now came up the staircase; he had
lacked the courage to be present at the Doctor's visit and to
inquire the truth as to his mother's danger. However, the
mournful silence with which he was greeted forced the
knowledge upon him in spite of himself, and he turned very
pale.</p>

<p>'My dear boy,' said the Doctor, 'you had better come
along with me. I will give you some lunch and bring you
back with me in the evening.'</p>

<p>The young man turned yet more pallid and replied: 'No,
thank you; I would rather not go away.'</p>

<p>From that moment Lazare waited, feeling a terrible pressure
upon his breast, as if an iron band were drawn tightly round
him. The day seemed as though it would never end, and
yet it passed away without any consciousness on his part of
how the hours went by. He had no recollection of how he
had spent them, wandering restlessly up and down the stairs,
and gazing out upon the distant sea, the sight of whose
ceaseless rocking dazed him yet more. At certain moments
the irresistible flight of the minutes seemed to be materialised,
and to become the onslaught of a mass of granite driving
everything into the abyss of nothingness. Then he grew
exasperated and longed for the end, in order that he might be
released from the strain of that terrible waiting. About four
o'clock, as he was once more creeping up to his own room,
he turned suddenly aside and entered his mother's chamber.
He felt a desire to see her and kiss her once again. But, as
he bent over her, she went on pouring out her incoherent
talk, and did not even turn her cheek towards him in that
weary manner with which she had received him ever since
the beginning of her illness. Perhaps she did not see him,
he thought; indeed, it was no longer his mother who lay there
with that livid face and lips already blackened.</p>

<p>'Go away,' Pauline said to him gently. 'Go out for a
little while. I assure you that the hour has not yet come.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p>And then, instead of going up to his room, Lazare
rushed downstairs and out of the house, ever with the sight
of that woeful face, which he could no longer recognise,
before him. He told himself that his cousin had lied, that
the hour was really at hand; but then he was stifling, and
needed space and air, and so he rushed on like a madman.
The thought that he would never, never again see his mother
tortured him terribly. But he fancied he heard some one
running after him, and when he turned and saw Matthew,
who was trying to overtake him at a heavy run, he flew
without cause into a violent passion, and picked up stones and
hurled them at the dog, storming at him the while, to drive
him back to the house. Matthew, amazed at this reception,
trotted back some distance, and then turned and gazed at his
master with his gentle eyes, in which tears seemed to glisten.
He persisted in following Lazare from a distance, as though
to keep watch over his despair, and the young man found it
impossible to drive him away. But the immensity of the sea
had an irritating effect upon Lazare, and he fled into the
fields and wandered about them, looking for out-of-the-way
corners where he could feel alone and concealed. He prowled
up and down till night fell, tramping over ploughed land,
breaking his way through hedges. At last, worn out, he was
returning homewards, when he beheld a sight which thrilled
him with superstitious terror. At the edge of a lonely road
there stood a lofty poplar, black and solitary, over which the
rising moon showed like a yellow flame; and the tree suggested
a gigantic taper burning in the dusk at the bedside of some
giantess lying out there across the open country.</p>

<p>'Come, Matthew! Come!' he cried in a choking voice.
'Let us get on!'</p>

<p>He reached the house running, as he had left it. The dog
had ventured to draw near, and licked his hands.</p>

<p>Although the night had now fallen, there was no light in
the kitchen. It was empty and dark, with only the glow
of the charcoal embers reddening the ceiling. The gloom
weighed upon Lazare, and he lacked the courage to go further.
Overcome with fear and emotion, he remained standing amidst
the litter of pots and dusters, and strained his ears to catch
the sounds with which the house was quivering. On one
side he heard a slight cough; it came from his father, to
whom Abbé Horteur was talking in low continuous tones.
But what most frightened the young man was the sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
hushed voices and hasty steps on the stairs, and a muffled
noise on the upper floor, which he could not account for,
though it suggested something being hurriedly accomplished
with as little noise as possible. He did not dare to go and
see what it meant. Could it be all was over? He was still
standing there perfectly motionless, without courage enough
to go and inquire the truth, when he saw Véronique come
down. She rushed into the kitchen, lighted a candle, and
carried it away with her so hurriedly that she neither spoke
to the young man nor looked at him. The kitchen, after
being lighted for a moment, relapsed into darkness. Up
above the stir was ceasing. Once more did the servant come
down, this time to get a bowl, and again she displayed silent,
desperate haste. Lazare no longer felt any doubt. All must
be over. Then, overcome, he sank down upon the edge of
the table, and waited amidst that darkness, without knowing
for what he was waiting, his ears buzzing the while in the
deep silence that had just fallen.</p>

<p>Upstairs, for two hours past, Madame Chanteau's last
agony&mdash;an agony so awful that it thrilled Pauline and
Véronique with horror&mdash;had been following its course. Her
dread of poison having reappeared, she raised herself up in
bed, still wildly rambling on, gradually mastered by furious
delirium. She wished to jump out of bed and escape from
the house, where someone wanted to kill her; and it was all
that the young girl and the servant could do to restrain her.</p>

<p>'Let me go! I shall be murdered! I must escape at
once, at once!'</p>

<p>Véronique tried to calm her.</p>

<p>'Oh! Madame, don't you see us? You can't suppose
that we should let any harm come to you.'</p>

<p>The dying woman, exhausted by her violent struggles, lay
for a moment panting. Her dim eyes wandered anxiously
round the room, as though she were looking for something.
Then she resumed:</p>

<p>'Shut up the secrétaire! It is in the drawer. Ah! there
she is coming upstairs! Oh! I am afraid! I tell you that
I can hear her! Don't give her the key. Let me go, at
once, at once!'</p>

<p>Then again she began to struggle, while Pauline held her
in her arms.</p>

<p>'Aunt, there is no one here. There are only ourselves.'</p>

<p>'No! no! Listen! There she is! Oh, God! God! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
shall die! The hussy has made me drink it all&mdash;I am going
to die! I am going to die!'</p>

<p>Her teeth chattered, and she sought protection in the arms
of her niece, whom she did not recognise. Pauline mournfully
strained her to her heart, no longer fighting against that
horrible suspicion, but resigning herself to the knowledge
that her aunt would carry it to her grave.</p>

<p>Fortunately Véronique was watching, and threw her arms
forward crying:</p>

<p>'Take care, Mademoiselle! Take care!'</p>

<p>It was the supreme convulsive struggle. By a violent
effort Madame Chanteau had succeeded in throwing her
swollen legs out of bed, and, but for the servant's presence,
she would have fallen on the floor. Her whole body was
shaken by delirium; she broke into incoherent spasmodic
cries, while her fists clenched as though she were engaging
in a close struggle, defending herself against some phantom
that clutched her by the throat. At that supreme moment
she must have understood that she was dying; there was an
expression of intelligence in her eyes which horror dilated.
For a moment a frightful spasm of pain made her press her
hands to her breast. Then she fell back on her pillow and
turned black. She was dead.</p>

<p>Deep silence fell. Pauline closed her aunt's eyes, but
she was exhausted, and incapable of doing anything further.
When she left the room, leaving there both Véronique and
Prouane's wife, whom she had sent for after the Doctor's
visit, her strength gave way; she was obliged to sit down for
a moment on the stairs, and no longer felt the courage to go
and tell Lazare and Chanteau the truth. The walls seemed
to be turning round her. A few minutes went by; then she
again laid her hand upon the banister, but on hearing Abbé
Horteur's voice in the dining-room she preferred to enter the
kitchen. And there she found Lazare, whose gloomy face
showed against the red glow of the embers in the grate.
Without speaking a word she stepped towards him and opened
her arms. He understood, and threw himself upon the young
girl's shoulder, while she pressed him to her in a long embrace.
They kissed each other on the face, while she wept silently;
but he was unable to shed a single tear; emotion was stifling
him, he could scarcely breathe. At last the girl unclasped her
arms, saying the first words that came to her lips:</p>

<p>'Why are you here without a light?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>He made a gesture, as though to signify that he had no
need of any light in his great sorrow.</p>

<p>'We must light a candle,' she said.</p>

<p>Lazare had fallen upon a chair again, incapable, as he
was, of keeping on his feet. Matthew restlessly wandered
about the yard, sniffing the damp night air. At last he came
back into the kitchen and looked keenly at them in turn, and
then went and rested his head on his master's knee, remaining
there and silently questioning him, with his eyes fixed
upon the young man's. Lazare began to tremble at the
dog's persistent gaze, and suddenly the tears gushed from his
eyes and he burst into sobs, throwing his arms the while
round the neck of the old dog which his mother had loved
for fourteen years. And he began to stammer in broken
words:</p>

<p>'Ah! my poor old fellow! my poor old fellow! We shall
never see her again!'</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her emotion, Pauline had succeeded in
finding and lighting a candle. She made no attempt to console
Lazare; she was glad to find him able to shed tears. There
was still a painful task before her, that of informing her
uncle of his wife's death. Just as she was making up her
mind to go into the dining-room, whither Véronique had
taken a lamp at the beginning of the evening, Abbé Horteur
had managed to explain to Chanteau, in long ecclesiastical
phrases, that there was no chance of his wife's recovery, and
that her death was only a question of hours. And so when
the old man saw his niece enter the room, overcome with
emotion and her eyes red from weeping, he knew what had
happened, and his first words were:</p>

<p>'<i>Mon Dieu</i>! there was only one thing that I would have
asked for: I should have liked to see her once more while she
lived!&mdash;But, ah, these wretched legs of mine! These
wretched legs!'</p>

<p>He said scarcely anything else. He shed a few bitter
tears which quickly dried, and vented a few sighs, but he
speedily returned to the subject of his legs, falling foul of
them and ending by pitying himself. For a few moments
they discussed the possibility of carrying him to the first floor
in order that he might give the dead woman a last kiss; but,
apart from the difficulties of the task, they considered that
the emotion of such a farewell might have a dangerous effect
on him; and, besides, he did not seem very anxious about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
matter himself. So he remained in the dining-room near the
draught-board, without knowing how to occupy his poor weak
hands, and not even having his head clear enough, he said, to
be able to read and understand the newspaper. When they
carried him to bed, old memories seemed to awaken in him,
for he shed many tears.</p>

<p>Then came two long nights and a day that seemed endless:
those terrible hours during which death dwells in the
house. Cazenove had only returned to certify the death,
once more surprised by the rapidity with which the end had
come. Lazare did not go to bed the first night, but spent his
time till morning in writing to his relations at a distance.
The body was to be taken to the cemetery at Caen and buried
in the family vault there. The Doctor had kindly promised
to see to all the formalities, and the only painful matter in
connection with them was the necessity for Chanteau, as
Mayor of Bonneville, to receive the declaration of his wife's
death. As Pauline had no suitable black dress, she hastened
to make one out of an old skirt and a merino shawl, which
she cut into a bodice. In the midst of these occupations
the first night and the following day passed; but the second
night seemed endless, rendered the more interminable by the
mournful prospect of the morrow. No one was able to get
any sleep; the doors remained open, and lighted candles were
left upon the stairs and tables, while even the most distant
rooms reeked of carbolic acid. They were all in the grasp of
grief, and went about with blurred eyes and clammy lips,
feeling but one dim need, that of clutching hold of life once
more.</p>

<p>At last, about ten o'clock the next morning, the bell of the
little church on the other side of the road began to toll. Out
of respect to Abbé Horteur, who had behaved so well and
kindly under the sad circumstances, the family had determined
that the religious ceremony should be performed at Bonneville,
before the body was removed to the cemetery at Caen. As
soon as Chanteau heard the bell toll, he began to wriggle
about in his chair.</p>

<p>'I must see her go away, at any rate,' he repeated, 'Oh!
these wretched legs of mine! What a misery it is to have
such wretched legs as mine are!'</p>

<p>It was to no purpose that they tried to keep him from
beholding the mournful spectacle. As the bell began to toll
more quickly, he grew angry and exclaimed:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>'Wheel me out into the passage. I can hear them bringing
her down. Be quick! be quick! I must see her go
away!'</p>

<p>Pauline and Lazare, who were in full mourning and had
already put on their gloves, were obliged to do as he bade
them. Standing, the one on his right and the other on his
left, they wheeled the arm-chair to the foot of the staircase.
Four men were just bringing the corpse downstairs, bending
beneath its great weight. As Chanteau caught sight of the
coffin, with its new wood and glittering handles and large
brass name-plate, he made an instinctive effort to rise, but
his leaden legs kept him down, and he was obliged to remain
seated in his chair, shaken by such a convulsive trembling
that his very jaws chattered. The narrowness of the staircase
made the descent difficult, and he gazed at the big yellow box
as it slowly came towards him, and, as it passed his feet, he
bent over to read the inscription on the plate. There was
more room in the passage, whence the bearers moved quickly
towards the bier, which was standing before the door.
Chanteau's eyes were still fixed on the coffin, and with it he
saw forty years of his life depart, happy years and unhappy
years, which he sadly regretted, as one ever does regret
one's youth. Pauline and Lazare were weeping behind his
chair.</p>

<p>'No, no! Leave me here!' he said to them, as he saw
them prepare to wheel him back again to his place in the
dining-room. 'You go along; I will stay here and watch.'</p>

<p>The bearers had laid the coffin on the bier, which was
lifted by some other attendants. The little procession was
formed in the yard, which was full of people of the neighbourhood.
Matthew, who had been shut up since early
morning, was whining from under the door of the coach-house
amidst the profound silence; while Minouche, seated on the
kitchen window-sill, examined with an air of surprise both the
concourse of people and the box that was being carried away.
As they still continued to linger, the cat grew tired of watching
and began to lick her stomach.</p>

<p>'You are not going, then?' Chanteau said to Véronique,
whom he had just perceived near him.</p>

<p>'No, sir,' she replied in a choking voice. 'Mademoiselle
told me to stay with you.'</p>

<p>The church-bell was still tolling, and at last the coffin
left the yard, followed by Pauline and Lazare, whose blackness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
seemed intensified by the sunlight. And, sitting in his
invalid's chair in the open doorway of the hall, Chanteau
watched his wife's body being borne away.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="VII" id="VII">VII</a></h3>


<p>The funeral matters and certain business affairs that had to
be attended to detained Lazare and Pauline in Caen for a
couple of days. When they set out on their journey home,
after paying a farewell visit to the cemetery, the weather had
broken up and there was a strong gale blowing. They left
Arromanches in a storm of rain, and the wind blew so strongly
that it threatened to carry the hood of their trap away.
Pauline thought of her first journey when Madame Chanteau
had brought her from Paris. It was just such a stormy day
as this, and her poor aunt had kept warning her not to lean
out of the conveyance, while perpetually refastening a muffler
that she wore round her neck. Lazare, too, in his corner of
the trap, sat thinking of the past, and in his mind's eye saw
his mother waiting to welcome him after each of his journeys
along that road as she had ever done. One December, he
remembered, she had walked a couple of leagues to meet him,
and he had found her seated on yonder milestone. Thus
reflecting, amidst the rain which poured unceasingly, the
girl and her cousin did not exchange a single word between
Arromanches and Bonneville.</p>

<p>Just as they were reaching home, however, the downpour
stopped, but the wind's violence increased, and the driver was
obliged to alight from his seat and take hold of the horse's
bridle. At the moment of reaching the house Houtelard,
the fisherman, ran past them.</p>

<p>'Ah! Monsieur Lazare!' he cried; 'it's all done for this
time! The sea's breaking all your timbers to bits down
yonder!'</p>

<p>The sea was not visible from that bend of the road. The
young man, who had raised his head, had just caught sight of
Véronique standing on the terrace and gazing towards the
shore. On the other side, sheltering himself behind his
garden wall, for fear lest the wind should rend his cassock,
Abbé Horteur stood straining his eyes in the same direction.
He bent forward and cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>'It's washing your piles away!'</p>

<p>Thereupon Lazare walked down the hill, followed by
Pauline, in spite of the storminess of the weather. When
they came to the foot of the cliff they were amazed by the
sight which they beheld. It was one of the September flood-tides,
and the sea was rushing up in wild commotion. No
warning had been issued of any probable danger, but the gale,
which had been blowing from the north since the previous
day, had thrown the sea into such tumult that mountains of
water towered up in the distance and, rolling onward, broke
with a mighty roar over the rocks. In the far distance the
sea looked black beneath the shadow of the clouds which
raced over the livid sky.</p>

<p>'Get into the trap again,' said the young man to his
cousin. 'I will just see how things look, and come back
directly.'</p>

<p>Pauline made no reply, but followed Lazare as far as the
shore. There the piles and a great stockade which had
been recently constructed were being subjected to a frightful
assault. The waves, which ever seemed to be growing larger,
rushed against them in quick succession, like so many battering-rams.
They came on like an innumerable army; fresh
masses sprang forward without a moment's cessation. Their
huge green backs, crested with foam, curved on every side,
and sped forward with giant strength; and, as these monsters
dashed against the stockades, they burst into a mighty rain
of drops, then fell in a mass of white boiling foam, which the
sea seemed to suck in and carry away. The timbers cracked
beneath the violence of each of those furious onsets. The
supports of one groyne were already broken, and a great central
beam, still secured at one end, swayed hopelessly like the dead
trunk of a tree whose branches had been stripped off by
grape-shot. Two others offered more resistance, but they
were shaking in their fixings, as though gradually overpowered
in that surging grasp, which seemed bent on wearing out
their strength in order to dash them to pieces.</p>

<p>'I told you how it would be!' repeated Prouane, who was
very drunk, and stood leaning against the broken shell of an
old boat. 'I told you how it would be when the wind blew like
this. A lot the sea cares about that young man and his bits
of sticks!'</p>

<p>Jeers greeted these words. All Bonneville was there,
men, women, and children; and they were all very much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
amused at seeing the thundering slaps which fell upon the
stockades. The sea might smash their hovels to fragments;
they still loved it with an admiring awe, and they would
have felt it a personal insult if the first young man who tried
had been able to conquer it with a few beams and a couple
of dozen bolts. And they grew excited as with a feeling of
individual triumph as they saw the sea at last awake, unmuzzle
itself, and throw its great jaws forward.</p>

<p>'Look! look!' cried Houtelard. 'That's a smasher! It
has swept a couple of beams away!'</p>

<p>They called to each other, and Cuche tried to reckon up
the waves.</p>

<p>'It will take three more, and then you'll see! There's
one! That's loosened it! There's two! Ah! that's swept it
away! Two have sufficed to do it, you see! Ah, the old
hussy she is!'</p>

<p>He referred to the sea, uttering the word 'hussy' as if
it were a term of endearment. Affectionate oaths arose,
children began to dance whenever a heavier wave than usual
crashed and snapped another of the timbers. Yet another
broke, and yet another; there would soon be not one left,
they would all be crushed like fleas. But though the tide
still rose, the great stockade still remained firm. It was the
sea's struggle against this which was most anxiously awaited,
for it would be the decisive contest. At last the mounting
waves dashed between the timbers, and the spectators prepared
themselves to laugh.</p>

<p>'It's a pity the young man isn't here,' said that rascal
Tourmal in a jeering voice, 'or he might lean against it and
try to keep it up.'</p>

<p>A 'Hush!' made him silent, for some of the fishermen
had just caught sight of Lazare and Pauline. The latter,
who were very pale, had heard Tourmal's sneer, and they
continued to gaze at the disaster in silence. It was a mere
trifle, the smashing of those beams, but the tide would go on
rising for another two hours, and the village would certainly
suffer if the stockade did not hold out. Lazare had passed
his arm round his cousin's waist, and was holding her close
to him to protect her from the squalls which, as cutting
as scythe-blades, blew against them. A mournful gloom fell
from the black sky and the waves howled, and the two young
people, in their deep mourning, remained motionless amidst
the flying foam and the clamour that was ever growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
louder. Around them the fishermen were now waiting, still
with a jeering expression on their lips, but feeling increasing
anxiety.</p>

<p>'It won't last much longer now!' Houtelard murmured.
The stockade still resisted, however. At each wave that
struck it its black, pitch-coated timbers still showed forth
amidst the white waters. But as soon as one of the beams
was broken, the adjoining ones began to fall away, piece by
piece. For fifty years past the oldest men there had not
known such a heavy sea. Soon they had to retire, the
beams which had been torn away were dashed violently
against the others, and gradually wrought the complete
destruction of the stockade, whose fragments were furiously
hurled ashore. There was but one left upright, standing
there like a post marking a sandbank. The Bonneville
folks had given over laughing now; the women were carrying
off their crying children. The 'hussy' had fallen upon them
again, and the stupor that came of despairing resignation to
the ruin which was certainly at hand now fell on that little
spot, nestling so closely to the sea which both supported and
destroyed it. There was a hasty retreat, a gallop of heavy
boots. Everyone took refuge behind the walls of shingle, by
which alone the houses were now protected. Some of the
piles here were already yielding, planks had been knocked
out, and enormous waves swept right over the walls which
were too low to stay their course. Soon there was nothing
left to offer resistance, and a mass of water, dashing against
Houtelard's house, smashed the windows and deluged the
kitchen. Then there came perfect rout, and only the
victorious sea remained dashing unimpeded up the beach.</p>

<p>'Don't go inside!' the men shouted to Houtelard. 'The
roof will fall in.'</p>

<p>Lazare and Pauline had slowly retired before the flood.
It was impossible to render any assistance, and, climbing the
hill homewards, they were about half-way up it when the
girl turned, and gave a last look at the threatened village.</p>

<p>'Poor people!' she murmured.</p>

<p>But Lazare could not pardon them for their idiotic
laughter. He was wounded to the heart by that disaster,
which for him was a personal defeat; and, making an angry
gesture, he at last opened his mouth and growled:</p>

<p>'Let the sea lie in their beds, since they're so fond of it!
I certainly won't try to prevent it!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>Véronique came to meet them with an umbrella, for the
rain had begun falling heavily again. Abbé Horteur, who
was still sheltering himself behind his wall, called a few words
to them which they could not catch. The frightful weather,
the destruction of the stockade, and the woe and danger in
which they were leaving the village, cast additional sadness
upon their return home. The house seemed cold and bare
as they entered it; nothing but the wind, with its ceaseless
moaning, disturbed the silence of the mournful rooms.
Chanteau, who was dozing before a coke-fire, began to cry
as soon as they appeared. They refrained from going
upstairs to change their clothes, in order that they might
escape the terrible associations of the staircase. The table
was already laid and the lamp lighted, so they sat down to
dinner immediately.</p>

<p>It was a sinister night; the deafening shocks of the
waves, which made the walls tremble, broke in upon the few
words that were spoken. When Véronique brought the tea
into the room she announced that Houtelard's house and five
others were already swept away, and that half the village
would certainly share the same fate this time. Chanteau, in
despair at not yet having recovered his mental equilibrium
after the sufferings he had gone through, silenced her by
saying that he had enough troubles of his own, and didn't
want to hear about those of other people. When they had
put him to bed, the others went off to rest also, worn out as
they were with fatigue. Lazare kept a light burning till
morning; and half a score times at least during the night
Pauline anxiously slipped out of bed and gently opened her
door to listen; but only death-like silence now ascended from
the first floor.</p>

<p>The next day there commenced for the young man a
succession of those lingering, poignant hours which come in
the train of great sorrows. He awoke with the sensation of
recovering from unconsciousness after some painful fall, from
which his body was still stiff and bruised. Now that the
troubled dreams which had oppressed him had passed away,
his mind vividly recalled the past. Each little detail presented
itself clearly before him, and he lived all his griefs
again. The reality of death, which had never been within
his personal experience, was brought home to him by the loss
of his poor mother, who had been so suddenly carried off
after a few days' illness. His horror of ceasing to be seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
to assume a more tangible form. There had been four of
them, but now there was a yawning gap in their midst, and
three of them were left behind to shiver painfully in their
wretchedness, and cling desperately to each other in their
attempts to regain some fragment of lost vital warmth. This,
then, was death: this was the 'Nevermore'&mdash;a circling of
trembling arms around a shadow, of which naught remained
save a wild regret.</p>

<p>Every hour, as the image of his mother arose before
him, Lazare seemed to be losing her over again. At first he
had not suffered so much, not even when his cousin had
come downstairs and thrown herself into his arms, nor during
the prolonged misery of the funeral. It was only since his
return to the empty house that he had felt the full weight
of his loss; and he grew wild with remorse that he had
not wept more and manifested greater grief while there yet
remained in the house something of her who was now for
ever gone.</p>

<p>Sometimes he would almost choke with sobs as he reproached
himself with not having loved his mother sufficiently.
He was perpetually recalling her; and her form was ever
before his eyes. When he went up the stairs he half expected
to see her come out of her room with the quick, short steps
with which she had been wont to hurry along the landing.
He often turned, fancying he heard her behind him, and he
was so absorbed in thinking of her that sometimes he even
felt sure that he heard the rustling of her dress behind the
door. At night he did not dare to extinguish his candle, and
in the dim light he fancied that he heard furtive sounds
approaching his bed, and a faint breath hovering over his
brow. His grief, instead of being assuaged, grew keener;
at the least recollection came a nervous shock, a vivid but
fugitive apparition, which, as it faded away, left him in all
the anguish which the thought of death inspired.</p>

<p>Everything in the house reminded him of his mother.
Her room remained untouched; nothing had been changed,
a thimble was still lying upon the table beside a piece of
embroidery. The clock on the mantelpiece had been stopped
at twenty-three minutes to eight, the time of her death. He
usually shunned the room, though sometimes, as he was
hastily rushing upstairs, a sudden impulse constrained him
to enter it; and then, as his heart throbbed wildly within
him, it seemed to him that the old familiar furniture&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
secrétaire, the table, and especially the bed&mdash;had acquired an
awe-inspiring aspect, which made them different from what
they had formerly been. Through the shutters, which were
kept closed, there filtered a pale light, whose vague glimmer
added to his distress as he went to kiss the pillow on which
his mother's head had lain in the icy cold of death. One
morning when he went into the room he paused astounded.
The shutters had been thrown wide open and the full light of
day poured into the chamber. A bright sheet of sunshine
streamed over the bed to the very pillow, and the room was
decked with flowers, placed in all the vases that the house
possessed. Then he recollected that it was an anniversary,
the birthday of her who had departed; a day which had been
observed every year, and which his cousin had remembered.
There were only the flowers of autumn there&mdash;some asters,
marguerites, and the last lingering roses, already touched
by frost&mdash;but they were sweetly redolent of life, and they
set joyous colours round the lifeless dial, which seemed
to mark the arrest of time's progress. That pious womanly
observance filled Lazare with emotion, and for a long time he
remained there weeping.</p>

<p>The dining-room, the kitchen, and the terrace, too, equally
reminded him of his mother. All the little objects he saw
lying about suggested her to him. He was quite beset by
his mother's image, though he never spoke of it, and indeed,
with a feeling of uneasy shame, tried to conceal the constant
torture which he experienced. He even avoided mentioning his
mother's name, so that it might have been supposed that he
had already forgotten her, whereas all the time never a
moment passed without memory bringing a bitter pang to his
heart. It was only his cousin who penetrated his secret, and
when she spoke to him about it he took refuge in falsehoods,
protesting that he had put out his light at midnight, and had
been very busy over some work or other. And he almost
worked himself into an angry passion if he were further
pressed. He took refuge in his room, and there abandoned
himself to his reflections, feeling calmer in that retreat where
he had grown up, free from the fear of revealing to others the
secret of his distress.</p>

<p>At first he had tried to force himself to go out and resume
his long walks, thinking that by doing so he would at any
rate escape Véronique's grumpy taciturnity and the painful
sight of his father, who lay listlessly in his chair, not knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
how to occupy himself. But he now felt an invincible distaste
for walking; out of doors he grew weary with a weariness
that almost amounted to discomfort. The sea with its
perpetual surging, its stubborn waves that broke against the
cliffs twice a day, irritated him as being a mere senseless
force that recked nothing of his grief, and had gone on
wearing the same rocks away for centuries, without ever
shedding a single tear for the death of a human being. It
was too vast, too cold; and he hurried back home again and
shut himself up in his room, that he might feel less conscious
of his own littleness, less crushed between the boundlessness
of sea and sky. There was only one spot that had
any attraction for him, and that was the graveyard which
surrounded the church. His mother was not there, but he
could think of her there with a melting tenderness; and,
despite his horror of death, the place had a singularly calming
effect upon him. The tombs lay asleep, as it were, amongst
the grass; there were yew-trees which had sprung up in the
protecting shade of the church, and not a sound was to be
heard save the call of the curlews, hovering in the wind
from the open. There he forgot himself for hours amongst
the old tombstones, whence the very names of those who
had long since passed away had been obliterated by the heavy
rains from the west.</p>

<p>If Lazare had felt any belief in another world, if he had
been able to think that he would one day again meet those
he loved at the other side of the grave's black wall, he would
have been far happier; but this consolation was denied him,
he felt no doubt as to death being the end and extinction
of individual life. And yet his own individuality, which ill-brooked
the thought of being snuffed out, rose up in mutiny
against his convictions. What joy there would have been in
entering upon a fresh life elsewhere, far away amongst
the stars, a new existence in which he would have been
once again surrounded by all he loved! Ah! if he could
only believe in that, how the agony he now suffered would be
turned to sweetness, in looking forward to rejoin lost loved
ones! How thrilling would be their kisses at meeting, and
what blessedness it would be to live all together again
in some realm where there would be no more death! He
was racked with agony at the thought of the charitable
falsehoods of creeds compassionately designed to hide the
terrible truth from those too weak to bear it. No! Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
was the end of everything; nothing that we had loved could
ever bud into fresh life, the good-bye was said for ever.
Oh! those awful words&mdash;'for ever'! It was they that carried
his brain into the dizzy vertigo of empty nothingness.</p>

<p>One morning, as Lazare was brooding beneath the shadow
of the yews, he caught sight of Abbé Horteur at the bottom
of his vegetable garden, which was only separated from the
graveyard by a low wall. Wearing an old grey blouse and a
pair of wooden shoes, the priest was digging a cabbage-bed;
and, with his face browned by the keen sea air and the back
of his neck scorched by the sun, he looked like an old
peasant bending over his work. With a miserable stipend,
and without any casual remuneration in the shape of fees
in that little out-of-the-way parish, he would have died of
sheer starvation if he had not been able to eke out his
livelihood by growing a few vegetables. What little money
he had went in charity, and he lived quite alone, assisted
only by a young girl from the village, and often obliged to
cook his own meals. To make matters worse, the soil of
that rocky spot was scarcely good for anything, and the
wind withered the young plants, so that it was scarcely worth
while to cultivate the stony ground for the sake of the
meagre return he got. When he put his blouse on, he
always tried to keep himself from notice, for fear lest it
should give anyone cause to scoff at religion; and Lazare,
knowing this, was about to withdraw when he saw him
take his pipe out of his pocket, fill it with tobacco, and then
light it with a loud smacking of his lips. Just as he was
enjoying his first puffs, however, the Abbé caught sight of
the young man. He then made a hasty movement, as though
he wished to hide his pipe, but finally broke into a laugh, and
called:</p>

<p>'Ah! you are enjoying the fresh air. Come in and have
a look at my garden.'</p>

<p>And, as Lazare came up to him, he added gaily:</p>

<p>'Well, you see, you find me in the midst of a debauch.
It is the only pleasure I get, my friend, and I'm sure that
it will not offend God.'</p>

<p>Thereupon he put his pipe in his mouth again, and puffed
away freely, only taking it out at times to make a short
remark. For instance, the priest of Verchemont worried him.
That priest was a happy man, possessing a really fine garden
with a good and fruitful soil; but he never so much as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
touched a garden tool. And next the Abbé complained to
Lazare about his potatoes, which had been falling off for
the last two years, though the soil, he said, was exactly suited
to them.</p>

<p>'Don't let me disturb you,' Lazare replied. 'Please go on
with what you were doing.'</p>

<p>The Abbé then resumed his digging.</p>

<p>'Yes, indeed, I must get on,' he said. 'The youngsters
will be here for the catechism class presently, and I want to
get this bed finished before they come.'</p>

<p>Lazare had seated himself on a slab of granite, some
ancient tombstone, placed against the low wall of the churchyard.
He watched Abbé Horteur struggling with the stones
and listened to him while he talked on in a shrill voice that
suggested a child's; and, as the young fellow watched and
listened, he wished that he could be as poor and as simple-minded
as the priest, with a brain as empty and a body as
tranquil. The mere fact that the Bishop had allowed Abbé
Horteur to grow old in that wretched cure showed how
innocent and guileless the good man had the reputation of
being. Besides, he was one of those who never complain,
and whose ambition is satisfied so long as they have bread to
eat and water to drink.</p>

<p>'It isn't very cheerful living amongst all these tombs,'
the young man remarked, thinking aloud.</p>

<p>The priest stopped digging in surprise.</p>

<p>'What! not cheerful?'</p>

<p>'Well, you have got death perpetually before your eyes.
I should think you must dream about it at nights.'</p>

<p>The priest took his pipe out of his mouth and spat upon
the ground.</p>

<p>'No, indeed, I never dream about it at all. We are all
in the hands of God.'</p>

<p>Then, he began to dig again, driving his spade into the
ground with a blow of his heel. His faith kept him free
from fear, and his imagination never strayed beyond what
was revealed in the catechism. Good folks died and went
to heaven. Nothing could be simpler and more encouraging.
He smiled in a convinced sort of way; that stolid,
unwavering theory of salvation sufficed for his narrow
brain.</p>

<p>From that time forward Lazare visited the priest almost
every morning in his garden, He would sit down on the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
tombstone and forget his thoughts as he watched the Abbé
cultivating his vegetables; he even gained a temporary
tranquillity by the contemplation of the other's blind faith
which enabled him to live in the midst of death without
disquiet. Why couldn't he himself, he thought, become a
simple child again, like that old man? In the depths of his
heart he harboured some lurking hope that his dead faith
might be fanned into life again by his converse with the
guileless, simple-minded priest, whose tranquil ignorance had
such a charm for him. He began to bring a pipe with him,
and the pair of them smoked together while they chatted
about the slugs that devoured the salad plants, or the
manure that was too expensive, for it was seldom that the
priest spoke of God. With his spirit of tolerance and long
experience he reserved the Divinity for his own personal
salvation. Other people looked after their affairs in their
way and he looked after his in his fashion. After thirty years
of unavailing preaching and warning he now strictly confined
himself to the observance of his ministerial duties. It was
very kind of that young man, he thought, to come and see
him every day, and as, with his tolerant and charitable disposition,
he did not want to cavil with him nor to inveigh
against the theories which he must have brought back from
Paris, he preferred to keep on talking with him about the
garden; and thus Lazare, with his head buzzing with all the
priest's simple gossip, sometimes thought that he was really
on the point of relapsing into that happy age of ignorance
when fear is unknown.</p>

<p>But though the mornings thus glided away, Lazare every
night, up in his room, still brooded over the memory of his
mother, without being able to summon up enough courage to
put out his candle. His faith was dead. One day, as he sat
smoking with Abbé Horteur, the latter hastily put his pipe
out of sight on hearing the sound of footsteps behind the
pear-trees. It was Pauline, who had come to look for her
cousin.</p>

<p>'The Doctor is in the house,' said she, 'and I have asked
him to stay to lunch. You'll come in soon, won't you?'</p>

<p>She was smiling, for she had caught sight of the Abbé's
pipe beneath his blouse. The priest quickly pulled it out
again, with that cheerful laugh to which he was addicted
whenever he was discovered smoking.</p>

<p>'It's very silly of me,' he said. 'People would think I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
had been committing a crime. See! I am going to light it
again before you!'</p>

<p>'I tell you what, your reverence!' Pauline exclaimed
gaily; 'come and lunch with us and the Doctor, and you can
smoke your pipe afterwards.'</p>

<p>The priest was delighted, and immediately replied:</p>

<p>'Well yes, I accept. I will follow you directly. I must
just put my cassock on. And I will bring my pipe with me;
I promise I will.'</p>

<p>It was the first luncheon, since Madame Chanteau's death,
at which the dining-room had re-echoed with the sound of
laughter. Abbé Horteur smoked his pipe after dessert,
and this made them all merry, but he evinced such genial
humour over this indulgence that it at once seemed quite
natural. Chanteau, who had eaten heartily, grew quite lively
under the cheering influence of this fresh stir of life in the
house. Doctor Cazenove told stories about savages, while
Pauline beamed with pleasure at hearing all the noise,
hoping that it might perhaps draw Lazare from his moody
despondency.</p>

<p>After that luncheon, Pauline determined to revert to the
Saturday dinners, which had been broken off by her aunt's
death. The Abbé and the Doctor came regularly to these
repasts, and the family life was resumed on its old lines
once more. They jested together, and the widower would
clap his hands on his legs and protest that, if it wasn't for
that confounded gout, he would get up and dance, so jovial
did he feel. It was only Lazare who still remained in an
unsettled state; his gaiety was forced, and he often shook
with a sudden shudder while he was noisily chattering.</p>

<p>One Saturday evening, in the middle of dinner, Abbé
Horteur was summoned to the bedside of a dying man. He
did not even wait to empty his glass, but set off at once,
without paying any heed to the Doctor, who had visited the
man before coming to dine and had told the Abbé he would
find him already dead. The priest had shown himself so
weak in intellect that evening that as soon as his back was
turned Chanteau remarked:</p>

<p>'There are times when there seems to be very little in
him.'</p>

<p>'I would willingly change places with him,' Lazare
roughly rejoined. 'He is much happier than we are.'</p>

<p>The Doctor laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>'That may be so. Matthew and Minouche are also
happier than we are. Ah! I recognise in that remark of
yours the young man of to-day, who has nibbled at the
sciences and filled himself with discontent because they have
not enabled him to satisfy his old ideas of the absolute, ideas
which he sucked in with his mother's milk. At the very first
attempt you want to discover every truth in the sciences,
whereas we can barely decipher them, when, maybe, the
inquiry will go on for ever. Then you begin to say that
there is nothing in them, and you try to fall back upon your
old faith, which will have nothing more to do with you, and
so you drop into pessimism. Yes! pessimism is the disease
of the end of the century. You are a set of Werthers turned
upside down!'</p>

<p>This was the Doctor's favourite subject, and he grew quite
animated over it. Lazare, on his side, exaggerated his
denial of all certainty, and his belief in final and universal
evil.</p>

<p>'How can we live,' he asked, 'when at every moment
things give way beneath our feet?'</p>

<p>The old man yielded to an impulse of youthful passion as
he retorted:</p>

<p>'Why, just go on living! Isn't life itself sufficient?
Happiness consists in action.'</p>

<p>Then he abruptly addressed himself to Pauline, who was
listening with a smile on her face.</p>

<p>'Come now!' he said, 'tell us what you do to be always
cheerful!'</p>

<p>'Oh!' she replied, in a joking tone, 'I try to forget all
about myself, for fear lest I should grow melancholy, and I
think about others; that occupies my mind, and makes me
bear my troubles patiently.'</p>

<p>This reply seemed to irritate Lazare, who, prompted by a
spirit of malicious contradiction, asserted that women ought
to be religious; and he pretended that he could not understand
why Pauline had ceased to fulfil her duties for so long
a time. Thereupon the girl gave her reasons in her
tranquil manner.</p>

<p>'It is very easily explained,' she said. 'Confession proved
very distasteful to me and hurt my feelings, and it affects
many women, I think, in the same way. Then, again, I
can't bring myself to believe things that seem contrary
to reason. And, that being so, why should I tell a lie by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
pretending that I do believe them? And, besides, the
unknown in no way disquiets me; it can only be a logical
outcome of life, and it seems to me best to await it as
tranquilly as possible.'</p>

<p>'Hush! Here's the Abbé!' interrupted Chanteau, whom
this conversation was beginning to bore.</p>

<p>The man was dead, and the Abbé placidly finished
his dinner, after which they each drank a little glass of
chartreuse.</p>

<p>Pauline had now assumed the management of the household.
All the purchases and every detail of the establishment
came under her inspection, and a big bunch of keys dangled
from her waist. She took over the control as a matter of
course, and Véronique showed no sign of displeasure at it.
The servant had been very morose, however, since Madame
Chanteau's death, and almost appeared to be in a state of
stupor. Her affection for the dead woman seemed to revive,
and she once more began to treat Pauline with suspicious
surliness. It was to no purpose that the latter spoke softly
and soothingly to her; she took offence at a word, and could
often be heard muttering and grumbling to herself in the
kitchen. And whenever, after intervals of obstinate silence,
she indulged in those muttered soliloquies, she always appeared
to be overwhelmed by stupefaction at Madame
Chanteau's death. Had she known that her mistress was
going to die, she moaned to herself? If she had had any
notion of such a thing, she would never have thought of
saying what she had said. Justice before everything! It
wasn't right to kill people, even if they had their faults.
But she washed her hands of it all, she growled; it would
be so much the worse for the person who was the real cause of
the misfortune. Still, this assurance did not seem to calm her,
for she went on growling and struggling against imaginary
transgressions.</p>

<p>'What's the matter that you are perpetually worrying
yourself like this?' Pauline asked her one day. 'We both
did all we could; but we can do nothing against death.'</p>

<p>Véronique shook her head.</p>

<p>'Ah! people don't usually die like that. Madame Chanteau
was what she was, but she took me in when I was quite
a little girl, and I could cut my tongue out if I thought that
anything I ever said had aught to do with her death. Don't
let us talk about it any more; it would end badly.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>No further reference had been made by Pauline and
Lazare to their marriage. Chanteau, who was desirous of
bringing the matter to a conclusion, now that the main
obstacle to it had disappeared, had ventured to allude to it
one day when Pauline came and sat near him with her
sewing to keep him company. He felt a keen desire to retain
her beside him and a great horror of again falling into the
hands of Véronique should his niece ever leave him. Pauline,
however, gave him to understand that nothing could be
settled until the completion of the period of mourning. It
was not a feeling of propriety alone that prompted her to
make that vague reply, but she was also looking to time to
answer a question which she dared not attempt to answer
herself. The suddenness of her aunt's death, that terrible
blow from which neither she nor her cousin had yet recovered,
had brought about a kind of truce between their wounded
affections, from which they were gradually awaking, only
to suffer the more on finding themselves, amidst their irreparable
loss, face to face with their own distressful story:
Louise driven out of the house; their love shattered,
and, perhaps, the whole course of their existences modified.
What was to be done now? Did they still love each other?
Was their marriage possible or advisable? Questions like
these floated through their minds, amidst the stupor in
which they were left by the sudden blow that had fallen
upon them, and neither the one nor the other seemed anxious
to force on a solution.</p>

<p>With Pauline, however, the recollection of the insult
offered to her had lost much of its bitterness. She had long
ago forgiven Lazare, and was quite ready to place her hand
in his whenever he should show repentance. She had not
the least jealous desire to see him humiliate himself before
her; her only thought was for him, so that she might give
him back his promise if he no longer loved her. Her whole
anguish lay in that doubt: did he still love Louise?&mdash;or had
he forgotten her and returned to the old affections of his
early youth? However, as she thus thought of giving Lazare
up rather than make him unhappy her heart sank, for,
though she trusted she would have the courage to do so, if
necessary, she hoped she would die soon afterwards.</p>

<p>Ever since her aunt's death an impulse of generosity had
moved her to bring about a reconciliation between herself
and Louise. Chanteau might write to Louise, and she herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
would just add a line to say that she had forgotten what had
happened. They all felt so lonely and dull that the other's
presence would distract them from their gloomy thoughts.
Since the terrible shock of her aunt's death, all that had
happened previously seemed very far away, and Pauline had
often regretted that she had behaved so violently. Yet,
whenever she thought of speaking to her uncle on the subject,
a feeling of repugnance held her back. Wouldn't it mean
imperilling the future, tempting Lazare, and perhaps losing
him altogether? However, perhaps she might still have
found courage and pride enough to subject him to this risk,
if her sense of justice had not risen in revolt against it. It
was the treason alone that seemed to her so unpardonable.
And then, again, was she not capable of restoring happiness
and life to the house? Why call in a stranger, when she
was conscious that she herself was brimming over with
willing devotion and affection? Without being aware of it,
there was a touch of pride in her abnegation, and she was
a little jealous in her devotion. She yearned to be her
relatives' one and only solace.</p>

<p>From this time all Pauline's endeavours were turned in
that direction. She laid herself out in every way, to make
those about her cheerful and happy. Never before had she
shown herself so persistently cheerful and kindly. Every
morning she came down with a bright smile and fixed
determination to conceal her own griefs in order that she
might do nothing to add to those of others. Her gentle
amiability seemed to set all troubles at defiance, and she
possessed a sweet evenness of disposition which disarmed all
feeling against her. She was now in perfect health again,
strong and sound as a young tree, and the happiness that she
spread around her was the emanation of her own healthy
brightness. The arrival of each fresh day delighted her, and
she found a pleasure in doing what she had done the day
before, perfectly contented and quiet in mind, and looking
forward to the morrow without any touch of feverish expectation.
Though Véronique went on muttering in her kitchen,
and indulged in strange and inexplicable caprices, a fresh
burst of life was driving all mournfulness from the house;
the merry laughter of former days rang through the rooms
and echoed up the staircase. Chanteau himself seemed
particularly delighted by the change, for the gloominess of
the house had always weighed on him. Existence, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
case, had really become abominable, yet he clung to it with
the desperate clutch of a sick man who holds dearly to life,
though it be but pain to him. Every day that he managed
to live seemed to be a victory achieved, and his niece appeared
to him to brighten and warm the house like a beam of sunlight,
beneath whose rays death could not lay its chilly
touch upon him.</p>

<p>Pauline, however, had one source of trouble. Lazare
seemed proof against all her attempts to console him, and
she grew distressed as she saw him falling again into a
sombre mood. Lurking behind his grief for his mother,
there was a revival of his terror of death. Now that the
lapse of time was beginning to mitigate his original sorrow,
this terror of death asserted all its old sway over him,
heightened by the fear of hereditary disease. He felt sure
that he too would succumb to some derangement of his
heart, and he brooded over the certainty of a speedy and
tragic end. He was constantly listening to the sounds of
life within him, observing, in a state of nervous excitement,
the working of his stomach, kidneys, and liver; but it was
particularly his heart-beats which absorbed him. If he laid
his elbow upon the table, he heard his heart beating in his
elbow; if he rested his neck against the back of a chair, he
heard it throbbing there; if he sat down, if he went to bed,
he heard it beating in his thighs, his sides, his stomach; and
ever and ever its throbbing seemed to him to be telling out
his life like a clock that is running down. Dazed by this
constant study of his organism, he perpetually alarmed himself
with the fear that he was on the point of breaking down.
All his organs were worn out, he fancied, and his heart, which
disease had distended to a monstrous size, was about to rend
his frame in pieces by its hammer-like beating.</p>

<p>In this way Lazare's mental sufferings went on increasing.
For many years, every night as he lay down in bed
the thought of death had frozen him to the marrow, and now
he dared not go to sleep, racked as he was with the fear of
never awaking. Sleep was hateful to him, and he experienced
all the horror of dying as he felt himself growing drowsy,
falling into the unconsciousness of slumber. His sudden
waking gave him still a greater shock, dragging him out of
black darkness, as though some giant hand had clutched him
by the hair and hurled him back into life again, shivering and
stammering with horror of the mysterious unknown through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
which he had passed. He clasped his hands convulsively, more
desperate and panic-stricken than ever at the thought that he
must die. He suffered such torture every night that he preferred
not to go to bed. He found that he could lie down on
the sofa and sleep in the daytime in perfect peace, and it was
probably that heavy slumber during the day which made his
nights so terrible. By degrees he gave over going to bed at
night at all, preferring his long siestas of the afternoon, and
afterwards only dozing off towards daybreak, when the fear
of darkness was driven away.</p>

<p>He had, however, intervals of calmness, and at times he
would remain free from his haunting fears of death for two
or three nights in succession. One day Pauline found an
almanack in his room, dotted over with red ink. She asked
him the meaning of the marks.</p>

<p>'What have you marked it for like this? Why are all
those days dotted?'</p>

<p>'I haven't marked anything,' he stammered. 'I know
nothing about it.'</p>

<p>Then his cousin said gaily: 'I thought it was only girls
who trusted to their diaries things that they wouldn't tell
anyone else. If you have been thinking about us on all the
days you have marked, it is very nice of you indeed. Ah! I
see you have secrets now!'</p>

<p>However, as she saw him become more and more disturbed,
she was good-natured enough to press him no further.
On the young man's pale brow she saw the shadow which
she knew so well, the shadow left by that secret trouble which
she seemed powerless to alleviate.</p>

<p>For some time past he had also been astonishing her by
fresh eccentricities. Possessed by a firm conviction that
his end was close at hand, he never left a room, or closed a
book, or used anything without thinking that it was the last
time he would do so, and that he would never again see
the thing he had used, the book he had closed, or the room he
had left; and he had thus contracted a habit of bidding
continual farewells, yielding to a morbid craving to take up and
handle different objects that he might see them once more.
With all this were mingled certain ideas of symmetry. He
would take three steps to the right and then as many to the
left, and touch the different articles of furniture on either side
of a window or door the same number of times. And beneath
this there lurked the superstitious fancy that a certain number<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of touchings, some five or seven, for instance, distributed in a
particular fashion, would prevent the farewell from being a
final one. In spite of his keen intelligence and his denial of
the supernatural, he carried out these foolish superstitious
practices with animal-like docility, though trying to hide them
as though they were some shameful failing. This was the
revenge taken by the deranged nervous system of this pessimist
and positivist, who declared that he believed only in
what was actually known. He was becoming quite a nuisance,
though.</p>

<p>'Why are you pacing up and down like that?' Pauline
cried at times. 'That's three times you've gone up to that
cupboard and touched the key. It won't run off!'</p>

<p>In the evening it seemed as though he would never be able
to get away from the dining-room. He arranged all the
chairs in a certain order, tapped the door a particular number
of times, and then entered the room again to lay his hands,
first the right and then the left, on his grandfather's masterpiece.
Pauline, who waited for him at the foot of the stairs,
at last broke out into a peal of laughter.</p>

<p>'What idiotic behaviour for a man of twenty-four! Where
is the sense, I should like to know, in touching things in that
way?'</p>

<p>But after a time she ceased to make a jest of him, for she
felt much distressed by his disquietude. One morning she
surprised him kissing&mdash;seven times in succession&mdash;the framework
of the bed on which his mother had died. The sight
filled her with alarm, and she began to guess the torments
which embittered his existence. When she saw him turn
pale as he came upon a reference to the twentieth century in
a newspaper, she gave him a compassionate glance which
made him turn his head aside. He recognised that she
understood him, and he rushed off and hid himself in his own
room, all shame and confusion. Over and over again did he
upbraid himself as a coward, and swear that he would resist
the influence of this weakness. He would argue with himself
and bring himself to look death in the face, and then in
a spirit of bravado, instead of passing the night awake on
his couch, he would quickly undress and jump into bed.
Death, he would then say to himself, might come and would
be welcome; he would await it there as deliverance. But
immediately the throbbing of his heart drove all his oaths
away, an icy breath seemed to freeze his bones, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
frantically stretched out his hands as he broke into a despairing
cry of 'O God! God!' It was these terrible backslidings
which filled him with shame and despair. His cousin's tender
pity, too, only served to overwhelm him. The days grew so
heavy that as he saw them begin he scarcely dared to hope
that they would ever end. In this gradual decay of his
vitality, his cheerfulness had been the first to depart, and now
physical strength seemed to be failing him in its turn.</p>

<p>Pauline, however, in the pride of her self-devotion, was
determined to gain the victory. She recognised the source
of her cousin's disease, and tried to impart to him some of
her own courage by giving him a love of life. But her
compassionate kindliness seemed to receive a continual check.
At first she made open attacks upon him with her old jests
and jokes about 'that silly, stupid pessimism.' 'What!'
she said, 'was it she now who had to chant the praises of
the great Saint Schopenhauer, while he, like all the humbugging
pessimists, was quite willing to see the world blown
to pieces, but refused to be blown up himself?' These jests
wrung a constrained smile from the young man, but he
seemed to suffer from them so much that she did not persist
in them. She next tried the effect of such caressing consolations
as might be lavished upon a child, and encompassed
him with cheerful amiability and placid laughter. She
always let him see her beaming with happiness and revelling
in, the pleasantness of life. The house seemed full of sunshine.
There was nothing more required of him than to
take advantage of it and let his life flow quietly on, but this
he could not do; the happiness that was offered to him only
made his feeling of horror at what was to come hereafter
all the keener. Then Pauline tried stratagem, and racked
her brain to promote enthusiasm in something or other which
might have the effect of making him forget himself. But
his idleness had become a sort of disease; he had no inclination
for anything whatever, and found even reading too
great an exertion, so that he spent his whole time in gnawing
at himself.</p>

<p>For a moment Pauline had a glimpse of hope. They had
gone one day for a short walk on the sands, when Lazare, as
they reached the ruins of the stockades, a few of the beams
of which were still standing upright, began to explain a
new system of protective works which, he assured her,
could not fail to prove successful. The collapse of the former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
ones had been caused by the weakness of the supporting
timbers. It would only be necessary to double their thickness
and to give a greater inclination to the central beams. His
voice vibrated and his eyes lighted up with all his old
enthusiasm as he spoke, and his cousin besought him to
take up the task again and make another effort. The
village was gradually being destroyed; every high tide swept
away a further portion of it; and there could be no doubt
that, if he went to see the Prefect, he would succeed in
obtaining the subvention, while she herself would be only
too glad to make further advances in order to assist such a
noble work. She was so anxious to spur him into action
that she would willingly have sacrificed the remains of her
fortune to bring about that end. But he only shrugged his
shoulders. What would be the good of it, he asked? He
turned pale as the thought struck him that, if he were to
commence the work, he would be dead before he could finish
it; and, to hide the perturbation which this reflection caused
him, he began to inveigh against the Bonneville fishermen.</p>

<p>'A pack of grinning idiots, who jeered at me when that
wolfish sea swept everything away! No! no! they may do
things for themselves now! I won't give them another
chance of laughing at my "bits of sticks," as they called them.'</p>

<p>Pauline tried to soothe him. The poor folk were in a
terrible state of wretchedness. Since the sea had carried off
the Houtelards' house, the most solidly built of all the village,
together with three others, cottages of the poorer fishermen,
their misery had increased. Houtelard, who had once been
the rich man of the district, had now taken up his quarters
in an old barn, some twenty yards behind his former dwelling;
but the others, who had no such refuge, were housing themselves
in clumsy huts made out of the shells of old boats.
They were living in a miserable state of nudity and promiscuousness;
the women and children were wallowing in vice
and vermin. All that was bestowed upon them in charity
went in drink. The wretched creatures sold all the food that
was given them, with their clothes, pots, and pans, and what
little furniture they had left, in order to buy drams of the
terrible 'calvados,' which stretched them on the ground across
their doorways like so many corpses. Pauline was the only
one who still continued to say a word for them. Abbé Horteur
had given them up, and Chanteau talked of sending in his
resignation, being unwilling to remain any longer the Mayor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
of such a drove of swine. Lazare, too, when his cousin
tried to excite his pity on behalf of that little colony of
drunkards, beaten down by the fierceness of the elements,
only repeated his father's eternal refrain:</p>

<p>'No one compels them to remain here. All that they have
to do is to go elsewhere. Only a pack of idiots would come
and stick themselves right under the waves.'</p>

<p>This was the general feeling of the neighbourhood, and
everyone looked upon the Bonneville folk as obstinate fools.
The villagers, on the other hand, were mistrustfully unwilling
to go elsewhere. They had been born there, they
said, and why should they have to leave the place? The
same sort of thing had been going on for hundreds and
hundreds of years, and there was nothing for them to do
anywhere else. Prouane, when he was exceptionally tipsy,
always concluded by saying that wherever they might go they
would always be devoured by something or other.</p>

<p>Pauline used to smile at this and nod her head in approval,
for happiness, in her opinion, depended neither upon people
nor circumstances, but on the more or less reasonable way in
which people conformed themselves to their circumstances.
She redoubled her care and attention, and distributed still
larger doles and alms than before. At last she was able to
induce Lazare to associate himself with her in her charities;
she hoped that she might thereby rouse him from his gloomy
broodings, and lead him to forget his own troubles by awaking
in him pity for those of others. Every Saturday afternoon
he remained at home with her, and from four o'clock till six
they received the young folk from the village, the ragged
draggle-tail urchins whom their parents sent up to get what
they could out of Mademoiselle Pauline. It was an invasion
of snivelling little lads and dirty little girls.</p>

<p>One Saturday it was raining, and Pauline could not distribute
her alms on the terrace, as was her custom. Lazare
had to fetch a bench and place it in the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Good gracious, sir!' Véronique exclaimed. 'Surely
Mademoiselle Pauline isn't going to bring all that dirty lot
in here? It's a nice idea, indeed; if they do come, I won't
answer for the state of the soup.'</p>

<p>At that moment the girl entered the kitchen with her bag
of silver and her medicine-chest. She merrily replied to
Véronique's indignant outburst:</p>

<p>'Oh! a turn of your broom will make things all right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
again; and, besides, it's raining so heavily that they will
have had a good washing before they come in, poor little
things!'</p>

<p>And, indeed, the cheeks of the first to enter were quite
bright and rosy from the downpour. They were so soaked
that pools of water trickled from their ragged clothes on to
the tiles of the kitchen-floor, thereby increasing the servant's
wrath, which was by no means diminished when Pauline
told her to light a faggot of wood to dry them a little. The
bench was carried near the fire, and was soon occupied by a
shivering row of impudent, leering brats, who cast greedy
eyes at what was lying about&mdash;some half-emptied wine-bottles,
the remains of a joint, and a bunch of carrots lying on a
block.</p>

<p>'Children indeed!' Véronique went on growling. 'Children
that are grown up and ought to be earning their own
living. They'll go on pretending to be children till they're
five-and-twenty, if only you'll let them!'</p>

<p>But Pauline bade her be silent.</p>

<p>'There! have you done now? Talking like that won't
fill their mouths or help them to grow up.'</p>

<p>The girl sat down at the table, with her money and the
other articles she intended to distribute in front of her;
and she was just about to call the children to her in turn,
when Lazare, who had remained standing, caught sight of
Houtelard's boy amongst the other youngsters, and shouted
out:</p>

<p>'Didn't I forbid you to come here again, you young
vulture? Your parents ought to be ashamed of themselves
for sending you here, for they are quite able to feed you,
whereas there are so many others who are dying of hunger.'</p>

<p>Houtelard's son, an overgrown lad of fifteen, with a timid
and sad expression, began to cry.</p>

<p>'They beat me if I don't come,' he said. 'The missis
got hold of the rope and father drove me out.'</p>

<p>He turned up his sleeve to show a big violet bruise on his
arm which had been caused by a blow from a piece of knotted
rope. The 'missis' was the old servant whom the lad's
father had married, and who was gradually killing the boy by
her ill-treatment. Since the loss of their house, their harshness
and miserly filthiness had increased, and now their home
was a perfect pigsty, where they tortured the lad, as if to
revenge themselves for their misfortunes on him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>'Put an arnica compress on his arm,' said Pauline softly
to Lazare.</p>

<p>Then she herself gave the lad a five-franc piece. 'Here!
give them this so that they shan't beat you any more, and tell
them that if they strike you again, and if there are any
bruises on your body next Saturday, they will never get
another sou out of me.'</p>

<p>All along the bench the other children, cheered by the
warming blaze, were now tittering and digging each other in
the ribs with their elbows. One tiny little thing had stolen
a carrot and was munching it furtively.</p>

<p>'Come here, Cuche!' said Pauline. 'Have you told your
mother that I hope to get her admitted very soon into the
Hospital for Incurables at Bayeux?'</p>

<p>Cuche's wife, a miserable abandoned woman, had broken
her leg in July, and had remained infirm ever since.</p>

<p>'Yes, I told her,' the lad replied in a hoarse voice; 'but
she says she won't go.'</p>

<p>He had grown into a strong young fellow, and was now
nearly seventeen years old. With his hands hanging at his
sides, he swayed about in an awkward manner.</p>

<p>'What! She won't go!' cried Lazare. 'And you won't
come, either; for I told you to come up this week and help a
little in the garden, and I'm still waiting for you.'</p>

<p>The lad still swayed himself about. 'I haven't had any
time,' he replied.</p>

<p>At this Pauline, seeing her cousin about to lose his
temper, interposed and said to the lad:</p>

<p>'Sit down again now, and we will speak about it presently.
Just reflect a little or you will make me angry too.'</p>

<p>It was next the turn of the Gonins' little girl. She was
thirteen years old, and still had a pretty rosy face beneath a
mop of fair hair. Without waiting to be questioned, she
poured out a flood of prattle, telling them how her father's
paralysis was ascending to his arms and even his tongue,
and that he could now only grunt like an animal. Cousin
Cuche, the sailor who had deserted his wife and installed
himself in Gonin's house, had made a violent attack upon
the old man that very morning, in the hope of finishing
him off.</p>

<p>'Mother sets on him too. She gets up at night and
empties bowls of cold water over father, because he snores so
loud and disturbs her. If you could only see what a state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
they have left him in, Mademoiselle Pauline! He is quite
naked, and he wants some sheets very badly, for all his skin
is getting grazed and peeling off!'</p>

<p>'There! That will do; hold your tongue!' said Lazare,
interrupting her chatter; while Pauline, moved to pity, sent
Véronique off to look out a pair of sheets.</p>

<p>Lazare considered the girl much too wide-awake for her
age, and he believed that, although she did perhaps sometimes
ward off a blow meant for her father, she treated him in the
long run no better than the others did. Moreover, he felt
quite sure that whatever was given to her, whether it was
money, or meat, or bed-linen, instead of being of any service
to the infirm old man, would only serve for the gratification
of his wife and cousin Cuche.</p>

<p>He began to question her sternly, for he had seen her
gadding about with several lads of the neighbourhood.
However, Pauline laid her hand upon his arm, for the other
children, even the youngest amongst them, were sniggering
and smiling with all the impudence of precocious vice. How
was it possible to arrest that spreading rottenness when the
men and women set so bad an example? When Pauline had
given the girl a pair of sheets and a bottle of wine, she
whispered to her for a moment or two, trying to frighten her
as to the consequences which might result from misbehaviour.
Warnings of this kind were the only ones that might hold
her in check.</p>

<p>Meantime Lazare, wishing to hasten the distribution, the
length of which was beginning to disgust and irritate him,
called up Prouane's daughter.</p>

<p>'Your father and mother were tipsy again last night,'
he said, 'and I hear that you were worse than either of
them.'</p>

<p>'Oh! no, sir! I had a very bad headache.'</p>

<p>He placed before her a plate in which were a few pieces of
raw meat.</p>

<p>'Eat that!'</p>

<p>She was devoured with scrofula again, and her nervous disorders
had reappeared. Drunkenness increased her precocious
infirmities, for she had acquired the habit of drinking with
her parents. When she had swallowed three lumps of the
meat, she stopped and made a grimace of disgust.</p>

<p>'I've had enough; I can't eat any more.'</p>

<p>But Pauline had taken up a bottle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>

<p>'Very well,' she said! 'if you don't eat the meat, you
shan't have your glass of quinine wine.'</p>

<p>On hearing this, the girl fixed her glistening eyes on the
glass, which Pauline filled, and overcame her repugnance
against the meat. Then she seized the glass and tossed its
contents down her throat with all a drunkard's knowing readiness.
But she did not then retire; she begged Pauline to
let her take the bottle away with her, saying that it interfered
too much with what she had to do to come up to the house
every day; and she promised to take the bottle to bed with
her, and to keep it so securely hidden that her father and
mother would never be able to find it and drink the wine.
Pauline, however, refused to let her have it.</p>

<p>'You'd swallow every drop of it before you got to the
bottom of the hill,' said Lazare. 'It's yourself that we
suspect now, you little wine-cask!'</p>

<p>One by one the children left the bench to receive money,
or bread, or meat. Some of them, after receiving their share
of the distribution, seemed inclined to linger before the blazing
fire, but Véronique, who had just noticed that half her
carrots had been devoured, drove them off pitilessly into the
rain. 'Had anyone ever seen anything like it before?' she
cried. 'Carrots, too, that still had all the earth sticking to
them!'</p>

<p>Soon there was no one left but young Cuche, who looked
very depressed in the expectation of receiving a severe lecture
from Pauline. She called him to her, spoke to him for a
long time in low tones, and finished by giving him his loaf
and the hundred sous which he received from her every
Saturday. Then he went off, with his clumsy swaying, having
duly promised to work, but having no intention whatever of
doing anything of the kind.</p>

<p>The servant was just giving a sigh of relief when she
suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Hallo! they haven't all gone yet, then! There's one of
them over there in the corner still!'</p>

<p>It was the Tourmals' little girl, the little abortion of the
high roads, who, notwithstanding her ten years, was still
quite a dwarf. It was only in shamelessness and effrontery
that she seemed to grow, and she groaned more miserably
and seemed more wretched than ever, trained for the profession
of begging from her cradle, just as some infants have
their bones manipulated in order that they may become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
acrobats. She crouched between the dresser and the fireplace,
as though she had stowed herself in that corner for
fear of being surprised in some wrong-doing.</p>

<p>'What are you up to there?' Pauline asked her.</p>

<p>'I am warming myself.'</p>

<p>Véronique cast an anxious glance round her kitchen. On
previous Saturdays, even when the children had assembled on
the terrace, various little articles had disappeared. That day,
however, everything seemed in its place, and the little girl,
who had hurriedly risen to her feet, began to deafen them
with her shrill voice:</p>

<p>'Father is in the hospital, and grandfather has hurt himself
at his work, and mother hasn't a gown to go out in.
Please have pity upon us, kind young lady&mdash;-'</p>

<p>'Do you want to split our ears, you little liar?' Lazare
cried angrily. 'Your father is in gaol for smuggling, and
when your grandfather sprained his wrist he was robbing the
oyster-beds at Roqueboise, and, if your mother hasn't got a
dress, she must manage to go out stealing in her chemise, for
she is charged with having strangled five fowls belonging to
the innkeeper at Verchemont. Do you think you can befool
us with your lies about matters that we know more of than
you do yourself?'</p>

<p>The child did not even appear to have heard him. She
went on immediately with all her impudent coolness:</p>

<p>'Have pity upon us, kind young lady! My father and
grandfather are both ill, and my mother dare not leave them.
God Almighty will bless you for it.'</p>

<p>'There! that will do! Now go away and don't tell any
more lies!' Pauline said to her, giving her a piece of money
to get rid of her.</p>

<p>She did not want telling twice, but hurried from the
kitchen and through the yard as quickly as her little legs
would carry her. Just at that moment the servant uttered
a cry:</p>

<p>'Ah! the cup that was on the dresser! She's gone off
with your cup, Mademoiselle Pauline!'</p>

<p>Then she bolted off in pursuit of the young thief, and a
couple of minutes afterwards dragged her back into the kitchen
with all the stern ferocity of a gendarme. It was as much as
they could do to search the child, for she struggled and bit
and scratched and screamed as though they were trying to
murder her. The cup was not in her pocket, but they discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
it next to her skin, hidden away in the rag which served
her as a chemise. Thereupon ceasing to weep, she impudently
asserted that she did not know it was there, that it must have
dropped into her clothes while she was sitting on the floor.</p>

<p>'His reverence was quite right when he said she would
rob you!' Véronique exclaimed. 'If I were you I would
send for the police.'</p>

<p>Lazare, too, began to speak about sending her to prison,
provoked as he was by the demeanour of the girl, who perked
herself up like a young viper whose tail had been trodden
upon. He felt inclined to smack her.</p>

<p>'Hand back the money that was given to you!' he cried.
'Where is it?'</p>

<p>The child had already raised the coin to her lips in order
to swallow it, when Pauline set her free, saying:</p>

<p>'Well, you may keep it this time, but you can tell them
at home that it is the last they will get. In future I shall
come myself to see what you are in need of. Now, be off
with you!'</p>

<p>They could hear the girl's naked feet splashing through
the puddles, and then all became silent. Véronique pushed
the bench aside and stooped down to sponge away the pools
of water that had trickled from the children's rags. Her
kitchen was in a fine state, she grumbled; it reeked of all that
filth to such a degree that she would have to keep all the
windows and doors open. Pauline, who seemed very grave,
gathered up her money and drugs without saying a word,
while Lazare, with an air of disgust and <i>ennui</i>, went out to
wash his hands at the yard tap.</p>

<p>It was great grief to Pauline to see that her cousin took
but little interest in her young friends from the village.
Though he was willing to help her on the Saturday afternoons,
it was only out of mere complaisance; his heart was
not in the work. Whereas neither poverty nor vice repelled
her, their hideousness depressed and annoyed Lazare. She
could remain cheerful and tranquil in her love for others,
whereas he could not cease to think of himself without finding
fresh reasons for gloomy broodings. Little by little, those
disorderly, ill-behaved children, in whom all the sins of
grown-up men and women were already fermenting, began to
cause him real suffering. The sight of them proved like an
additional blight to his existence, and when he left them he
felt hopeless, weary, full of hatred and disgust of the human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
species. The hours that were spent in good works only
hardened him, made him deny the utility of almsgiving and
jeer at charity. He protested that it would be far more sensible
to crush that nest of pernicious vermin under foot than to help
the young ones to grow up. Pauline listened to this, surprised
by his violence, and pained to find how different were
their views.</p>

<p>That Saturday, when they were alone again, the young
man revealed all his suffering by a single remark.</p>

<p>'I feel as though I had just come out of a sewer,' said
he. Then he added: 'How can you care for such horrible
monsters?'</p>

<p>'I care for them for their own good and not for mine,' the
girl replied. 'You yourself would pick up a mangy dog in
the road.'</p>

<p>Lazare made a gesture of protest. 'A dog isn't a man,'
he said.</p>

<p>'To help for the sake of helping, is not that something?'
Pauline resumed. 'It is vexing that they don't improve in
conduct, for, if they did, perhaps they would suffer less. But
I am content when they have got food and warmth; that is
one trouble less for them, at any rate. Why should you want
them to recompense us for what we do for them?'</p>

<p>Then she concluded sadly:</p>

<p>'My poor boy, I see that all this only bores you, and it
will be better for you not to come and help me in future. I
don't want to harden your heart and make you more uncharitable
than you already are.'</p>

<p>Thus Lazare eluded all her attempts, and she felt heart-broken
at finding how utterly powerless she was to free him
from his fear and <i>ennui</i>. When she saw him so nervous and
despondent, she could scarcely believe that it was the result
merely of his secret trouble; she imagined there must be
other causes for his sadness, and the idea of Louise recurred
to her. She felt sure that he must still be thinking about
the girl, and suffered from not seeing her. A cold chill came
upon her at this thought, and she tried to recover her old
feeling of proud self-sacrifice, telling herself that she was
quite capable of spreading sufficient brightness and joy about
her to make them all happy.</p>

<p>One evening Lazare made a remark that hurt her
cruelly.</p>

<p>'How lonely it is here!' he said, with a yawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked at him. Had he got Louise in his mind?
But she had not the courage to question him. Her kindliness
struggled within her, and life became a torture again.</p>

<p>There was another shock awaiting Lazare. His old dog,
Matthew, was far from well. The poor animal, who had
completed his fourteenth year in the previous March, was
getting more and more paralysed in his hind-quarters. His
attacks left him so stiff that he could scarcely crawl along;
and he would lie out in the yard, stretching himself in the
sun, and watching the members of the family with his
melancholy eyes. It was the old dog's eyes, now dimmed by
a bluish cloudiness, blank like those of a blind man, that
especially wrought upon Lazare's feelings. The poor animal,
however, could still see, and used to drag himself along, lay
his big head on his master's knee, and look up at him fixedly
with a sad expression that seemed to say that he understood
all. His beauty had departed. His curly white coat had
turned yellowish, and his nose, once so black, was becoming
white. His dirtiness, and a kind of expression of shame that
hung about him&mdash;for they dared not wash him any more on
account of his great age&mdash;rendered him yet more pitiable.
All his playfulness had vanished; he never now rolled on his
back, or circled round after his tail, or showed any impulses
of pity for Minouche's kittens when Véronique carried them
off to drown in the sea. He now spent his days in drowsing
like an old man, and he had so much difficulty in getting up
on his legs again, and dragged his poor soft feet so heavily,
that often one of the household, moved to pity at the sight,
stooped to support him for a moment or two in order that he
might be able to walk a little.</p>

<p>He grew weaker every day from loss of blood. They had
sent for a veterinary surgeon, who burst out laughing on
seeing him. What! were they making a fuss about a dog
like that? The best thing they could do was to put him out
of the way at once. It was all very well to try and keep a
human being alive as long as possible, but what was the good
of allowing a dying animal to linger on in pain? At this
they quickly bustled the vet. out of the house, after paying
him his fee of six francs.</p>

<p>One Saturday Matthew lost so much blood that it was
found necessary to shut him up in the coach-house. A stream
of big red drops trickled after him. Doctor Cazenove, who
bad arrived rather early, offered to go and see the dog, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
was treated quite as a member of the family. They found
him lying down, in a state of great weakness, but with his
head raised very high, and the light of life still shining in his
eyes. The Doctor made a long examination of him, with all
the care and thoughtfulness which he displayed at the bedside
of his human patients. At last he said:</p>

<p>'That abundant loss of blood denotes a cancerous degeneration
of the kidneys. There is no hope for him, but he
may linger for a few days yet, unless some sudden hæmorrhage
carries him off.'</p>

<p>Matthew's hopeless condition threw a gloom over the
dinner-table. They recalled how fond Madame Chanteau had
been of him, all the wild romps of his youth, the dogs he had
worried, the cutlets he had stolen off the gridiron, and the
eggs that he gobbled up warm from the nest. But at dessert,
when Abbé Horteur brought out his pipe, they grew lively
again and listened with attention to the priest as he told
them about his pear-trees, which promised to do splendidly
that year. Chanteau, notwithstanding certain prickings which
foreboded another attack of gout, finished off by singing
one of the merry songs of his youth. Thus the evening
passed away delightfully, and even Lazare himself grew
cheerful.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock, just as tea was being served, Pauline
suddenly cried out:</p>

<p>'Oh look! There's poor Matthew!'</p>

<p>And, in truth, the poor dog, all bleeding and shrunken, was
dragging himself on his tottering legs into the dining-room.
Then immediately afterwards they heard Véronique, who was
rushing after him with a cloth. She burst into the room,
crying:</p>

<p>'I had to go into the coach-house, and he made his escape.
He still insists upon being where the rest of us are, and one
can't take a step without finding him between one's legs.
Come! come! you can't stop here.'</p>

<p>The dog lowered his old trembling head with an expression
of affectionate entreaty.</p>

<p>'Oh! let him stop, do!' Pauline cried.</p>

<p>But the servant seemed displeased.</p>

<p>'No! indeed, not in such a state as that. I have had
quite enough to do, as it is, with wiping up after him. It's
really quite disgusting. You'll have the dining-room in a
nice state if he goes dragging himself all over the place in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
this way. Come along! Come along! Be a little quicker,
do!'</p>

<p>'Let him stay here, and you go away!' said Lazare.</p>

<p>Then, as Véronique furiously banged the door behind her,
Matthew, who seemed to understand the situation perfectly
well, came and laid his head on his master's knee. Everyone
wanted to lavish dainties on him; they broke up lumps of
sugar, and tried to brighten him up into liveliness. In times
past they had been accustomed every evening to amuse themselves
by placing a lump of sugar upon the table on the
opposite side to that at which the dog was stationed, and then
as Matthew ran round they caught up the sugar and deposited
it on the other side, in such wise that the dog went rushing
round the table in pursuit of the dainty which was ever being
removed from him, till at last he grew quite dizzy with the
perpetual flitting, and broke out into wild and noisy barking.
Lazare tried to set this little game going again, in the hope of
cheering the poor animal. Matthew wagged his tail for a
moment, went once round the table, and then staggered and
fell against Pauline's chair. He could not see the sugar, and
his poor shrunken body rolled over on its side. Chanteau
had stopped humming, and everyone felt keen sorrow at the
sight of that poor dying dog, who had vainly tried to summon
up the romping energies of the past.</p>

<p>'Don't do anything to tire him,' the Doctor said gently,
'or you will kill him.'</p>

<p>Then the priest, who was smoking in silence, let fall a
remark which was probably intended to account for his
emotion.</p>

<p>'One might almost imagine,' he said, 'that these big dogs
were human beings.'</p>

<p>About ten o'clock, when the priest and the Doctor had left,
Lazare, before going to his own room, went to lock Matthew in
the coach-house again. He laid him carefully down upon
some fresh straw, and saw that his bowl was full of water;
then he kissed him and was about to leave him, but the dog
raised himself on his feet with a painful effort, and tried to
follow the young man. Lazare, had to put him back three
times, and then at last the dog yielded, but he raised his head
with so sad an expression to watch his master depart that
Lazare, who felt heart-broken, came back and kissed him
again.</p>

<p>When he reached his room at the top of the house the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
young man tried to read till midnight. Then he went to bed.
But he could not sleep; his mind dwelt continually upon
Matthew; the image of the poor animal, lying on his bed of
straw, with his failing eyes turned towards the door, never
ceased to haunt him. On the morrow, he thought, Matthew
would be dead. Every minute he caught himself involuntarily
sitting up in bed and listening, fancying he heard a bark
in the yard. His straining ears caught all sorts of imaginary
sounds. About two o'clock in the morning he heard a
groaning which made him jump out of bed. Who could be
groaning like that? He rushed out on to the landing, but
the house was wrapped in darkness and silence, not a breath
came from Pauline's room. Then he could no longer resist
his impulse to go downstairs. The hope of once more seeing
his old dog alive made him hasten his steps; he scarcely gave
himself time to thrust his legs into a pair of trousers, before
he started off, taking his candle with him.</p>

<p>When he reached the coach-house Matthew was no
longer lying on the straw; he had dragged himself some
distance away from it, and was stretched upon the hard
ground. When he saw his master enter, he no longer had
enough strength to raise his head. Lazare placed his candle
on some old boards, and was filled with astonishment when
he bent down and saw the ground all black. Then a spasm
of pain came to him as he knelt and found that the poor
animal was weltering in his death-throes in a perfect pool of
blood. Life was quickly ebbing from him; he wagged his tail
very feebly, while a faint light glistened in the depths of his
eyes.</p>

<p>'Oh! my poor old dog!' sobbed Lazare; 'oh! my poor
old dog!'</p>

<p>Then, aloud, he said:</p>

<p>'Wait a moment! I will move you. Ah! I'm afraid
it hurts you, but you are drenched lying here; and I
haven't even got a sponge. Would you like something to
drink?'</p>

<p>Matthew still gazed at him earnestly. Gradually the
death-rattle shook his sides, and the pool of blood grew
bigger and bigger, quite silently, and as though it were fed
by some hidden spring.</p>

<p>Various ladders and broken barrels in the coach-house
cast great shadows around, and the candle burnt very dimly.
But suddenly there came a rustling among the straw. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
the cat, Minouche, who was reposing on the bed made for
Matthew, and had been disturbed by the light.</p>

<p>'Would you like something to drink, my poor old fellow?'
Lazare repeated.</p>

<p>He had found a cloth, which he dipped in the pan of
water and pressed against the dying animal's mouth. It
seemed to relieve him; and his nose, which was excoriated
through fever, became a little cooler. Half an hour passed,
during which Lazare constantly dipped the cloth in the
water, while his eyes filled with tears at the painful sight
before him, and his heart ached with all the bitterness of
grief. Wild hopes came to him at times, as they do to the
watchers at a bedside; perhaps, he thought, he might recall
ebbing life by that simple application of cold water.</p>

<p>'Ah! what is the matter? What do you want to do?'
he cried suddenly. 'You want to get on your feet, eh?'</p>

<p>Matthew, shaken by a fit of shivering, made desperate
efforts to raise himself. He stiffened his limbs, while his
neck was distended by his hiccoughs. But the end was close
at hand, and he fell across his master's knees, with eyes still
straining from beneath their heavy lids to catch sight of him.
Quite overcome by that glance, so full of intelligence, Lazare
held Matthew there on his knees, while the animal's big body,
heavy like that of a man, was racked by a human-like
death-agony in his sorrowing embrace. It lasted for some
minutes, and then Lazare saw real tears&mdash;heavy tears&mdash;roll
down from the dog's mournful eyes, while his tongue showed
forth from his convulsed mouth, as though for a last caress.</p>

<p>'Oh! my poor old dog!' cried Lazare, bursting into sobs.</p>

<p>Matthew was dead. A little bloody foam frothed round
his jaws. As Lazare laid him down on the floor he looked
as though he were asleep.</p>

<p>Then once more the young man felt that all was over.
His dog was dead now, and this filled him with unreasonable
grief and seemed to cast a gloom over his whole life. That
death awoke in him the memory of other deaths, and he had
not felt more heart-broken even when walking through
the yard behind his mother's coffin. Some last portion of
her seemed to be torn away from him; she had gone
from him now entirely. The recollection of his months of
secret anguish, of his nights disturbed by nightmare
visions, of his walks to the little graveyard, and of all his
terror at the thought of annihilation, surged up in his mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span></p>

<p>However, he heard a sound, and when he turned he saw
Minouche quietly making her toilet on the straw. But the
door creaked, and Pauline then entered the coach-house,
impelled thither by an impulse similar to that of her cousin.
When he saw her his tears fell faster, and he who had carefully
concealed all his grief at his mother's death, as though
it had been some shameful folly, now cried:</p>

<p>'Oh, God! God! She loved him so dearly! You
remember, don't you? She first had him when he was
quite a tiny little thing, and it was she who always fed him,
and he used to follow her all over the house!'</p>

<p>Then he added;</p>

<p>'There is no one left now, and we are utterly alone!'</p>

<p>Tears sprang up in Pauline's eyes. She had stooped to look
at poor Matthew's body lying there beneath the dim glimmer
of the candle. And she did not seek to console Lazare. She
made but a gesture of despair, for she felt that she was
utterly powerless.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p>It was <i>ennui</i> that lay below all Lazare's gloomy sadness, a
heavy continuous <i>ennui</i> which rose from everything, like
murky waters from some poisoned spring. He was bored
both with work and with idleness, and with himself even
more than with others. However, he took himself to task
for his idleness and felt ashamed of it. It was disgraceful
for a man of his age to waste the best years of his life in such
a hole as Bonneville. Until now he had had some excuse for
doing so, but at present there was no longer anything to keep
him at home, and he despised himself for staying there,
leading a useless existence, living upon his family, who
were scarcely able to keep themselves. He told himself that
he ought to be making a fortune for them, and that he was
failing shamefully in not doing so, as he had formerly sworn
he would. Great schemes for the future, grand enterprises,
the idea of a vast fortune acquired by some brilliant stroke of
genius, still occurred to him; but when he rose up from his
reveries he lacked the energy to turn his thoughts into action.</p>

<p>'I can't go on like this,' he often said to Pauline. 'I
must really do something. I should like to start a newspaper
at Caen.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>And his cousin always made the same reply:</p>

<p>'Wait till the time of mourning is over. There is no
hurry. You had better think matters well over before you
launch out into an undertaking like that.'</p>

<p>The truth was that, notwithstanding her desire to see him
occupy himself with some kind of work, she was alarmed by
this scheme of founding a newspaper. Another failure, she
feared, might kill him, and she thought of all his many previous
ones&mdash;music, medicine, the sea-weed works; everything,
in fact, that he had ever taken in hand. And, besides, a
couple of hours after he had mentioned this last plan to
her he had refused even to write a letter, on the ground that
he was too tired.</p>

<p>The weeks passed away, and another flood-tide carried off
three more houses at Bonneville. When the fishermen now
met Lazare they asked him if he had had enough of it.
Though it was really quite useless trying to do anything, they
said it grieved them to see so much good timber lost. There
was a touch of banter in their expressions of condolence
and in the manner in which they besought him not to leave
the place to the waves, as though with their sailor-natures
they felt a savage pride in the sea's destructive blows. By
degrees Lazare grew so annoyed with their remarks that
he avoided passing through the village. The sight of the
ruined piles and stockades in the distance became intolerable
to him.</p>

<p>One day, as he was on his way to see the priest, Prouane
stopped him.</p>

<p>'Monsieur Lazare,' he said obsequiously, while a mischievous
smile played round his eyes, 'you know those pieces
of timber which are rotting away down yonder on the shore?'</p>

<p>'Well, what about them?'</p>

<p>'If you're not going to use them again, you might give
them to us. They would serve, at any rate, as firewood.'</p>

<p>The young man was carried away by his anger, and, without
even thinking of what he was saying, he answered
sharply:</p>

<p>'That's quite impossible. I am going to set men to work
again next week.'</p>

<p>At this all the neighbourhood shouted. They were going
to have all the fun over again, since young Chanteau was
showing himself so pig-headed. A fortnight went by, and the
fishermen never met Lazare without asking him if he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
unable to find workmen; and thus he was goaded into a renewal
of his operations, being induced thereto, also, by the
entreaties of his cousin, who was anxious that he should have
some occupation which would keep him near her. But he
entered into the matter without the least spark of enthusiasm,
and it was only his revengeful enmity against the sea which
kept him saying that he was quite certain to triumph
over it this time, and would make it lick the pebbles on the
shore as submissively as a dog.</p>

<p>Once again Lazare set to work preparing plans. He
planned fresh angles of resistance and doubled the strength of
his supports. No excessive expense was going to be incurred,
as most of the old timbers could be used again. The carpenter
sent in an estimate of four thousand francs; and, as the
sum was so small, Lazare made no objection to Louise advancing
it, being quite certain, he said, of getting a subvention
from the General Council; indeed, he remarked that this was
the only means they had of getting their previous expenditure
reimbursed, for the Council would certainly refuse to
advance a copper so long as the works remained in their
present ruinous condition. This consideration seemed to
infuse a little warmth into his proceedings, and the operations
were pressed on. In other ways, too, he became very busy,
and went over to Caen every week to see the Prefect and the
influential members of the Council.</p>

<p>While the piles were being laid, an intimation was received
that an engineer would be sent to inspect the operations and
make a report, on the receipt of which the Council would vote
a subvention. The engineer spent a whole day at Bonneville.
He was a very pleasant man, and gladly accepted an invitation
from the Chanteaus to lunch with them after his visit to
the shore. They refrained from making any reference to the
subvention, as they were unwilling to appear in any way
desirous of influencing his judgment, but he showed himself
so polite and attentive to Pauline at table that she began to
feel no doubt as to their success in obtaining the grant. And
so, a fortnight later, when Lazare returned from one of his
visits to Caen, the whole house was thrown into amazement
and consternation by the news which he brought back with
him. He was bursting with anger. Would they believe it!
That silly fop of an engineer had sent in a simply disgraceful
report. Yes! he had been polite and civil, but he had made
fun of every single piece of timber with a ridiculous lavishness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
of technical terms. But it was only what they might have
expected, for those official gentlemen didn't believe that any
one could put even a rabbit-hutch together without their
advice and assistance! However, the worst of the matter
was that the Council, after reading the report, had refused to
vote any grant at all.</p>

<p>This blow was a source of fresh despondency to the young
man. The works were finished, and he swore that they
would resist the heaviest tides, and that the whole Engineering
Department would go wild with angry jealousy when they
saw them. All this, however, would not repay Pauline the
money that she had advanced, and Lazare bitterly reproached
himself for having led her into that loss. She herself, however,
rising victorious over the instincts of her economical
nature, claimed the entire responsibility for the course she had
taken, impressing upon him that it was she who had insisted
upon making the advances. The money had gone in a
charitable purpose, she said, and she did not regret a sou of it,
but would have gladly given more for the sake of saving the
unhappy village. However, when the carpenter sent in his
bill, she could not suppress a gesture of grievous astonishment.
The four thousand francs of the estimate had grown to
nearly eight thousand. Altogether, those piles and stockades,
which the first storm might completely sweep away, had cost
her more than twenty thousand francs.</p>

<p>By this time Pauline's fortune was reduced to forty thousand
francs, which produced a yearly income of two thousand
francs, a sum on which she would be barely able to live,
should she ever find herself homeless and friendless. Her
money had trickled away in small sums in the household
expenses, which she still continued to defray. But she now
began to exercise a strict supervision over all the outlay of
the house. The Chanteaus themselves no longer had even
their three hundred francs a month, for, after Madame
Chanteau's death, it was found that a certain amount of stock
had been sold without there being any clue as to how the
amount realised by its sale had been applied. When her own
income was added to that of the family, Pauline had little
more than four hundred francs a month with which to keep
the house going. The expenses of the establishment were
heavy, and she had to perform miracles of economy in order
to save the money that she needed for her charities. Doctor
Cazenove's trusteeship had terminated during the winter, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
Pauline, being now of age, her money and herself were entirely
at her own disposal; though indeed the Doctor during the
term of his authority had never refused to let her have her own
way. That authority had legally ceased for some weeks before
either of them remembered the fact. But, although Pauline
had been practically her own mistress for some time, she
felt more thoroughly independent, more like a fully-grown
woman, now that she was the uncontrolled mistress of the
house, with no accounts to render to anybody, for her uncle was
ever entreating her to settle everything, and Lazare, like his
father, also hated having anything to do with money matters.</p>

<p>Thus Pauline held the common purse and stepped entirely
into her aunt's place, performing her duties as mistress of the
house with a practical common-sense that sometimes quite
amazed the two men. It was only Véronique who made any
complaints, thinking that Mademoiselle Pauline was very
stingy, and grumbling at being restricted to a single pound of
butter a week.</p>

<p>The days succeeded each other with monotonous regularity.
The perpetual sameness, the unvarying habits of the
household, which constituted Pauline's happiness, only
tended to increase Lazare's feeling of <i>ennui</i>. Never had the
house affected him with such uneasy disquietude as now,
when every room seemed basking in cheerful peace. The
completion of the operations on the shore had proved a great
relief, for enforced attention to anything had become intolerable
to him, and he had no sooner fallen back into idleness
than he once more became the prey of shame and anxiety.
Every morning he made a fresh set of plans for the future.
He had abandoned the idea of starting a newspaper as unworthy
of him, and he inveighed against the poverty which
prevented him from quietly devoting himself to some great
literary work. He had lately become enamoured of the
notion of preparing himself for a professorship, and so earning
a livelihood and enabling himself to carry out his literary
ambition. There no longer seemed to exist between himself
and Pauline anything beyond their old feeling of comradeship,
a quiet affection which made them, as it were, brother
and sister. The young man never made any reference to their
marriage, either because he never thought of it, or, perhaps,
because he took it for granted and considered any discussion
of the matter unnecessary; while the girl herself was
equally reticent on the subject, feeling quite certain that her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
cousin would willingly acquiesce in the first suggestion of
their union. And yet Lazare's passion for her was gradually
diminishing; a fact of which she was quite conscious, though
she did not understand that it was this alone which rendered
her powerless to free him from his <i>ennui</i>.</p>

<p>One evening, when she had gone upstairs in the dusk to
tell him that dinner was ready, she surprised him in the act of
hastily hiding something which she could not distinguish.</p>

<p>'What's that?' she asked, with a laugh. 'Some verses
for my birthday?'</p>

<p>'No!' he replied, with much emotion and in wavering
tones. 'It's nothing at all.'</p>

<p>It was an old glove which Louise had left behind her, and
which he had just discovered behind a pile of books. The
glove had retained a strong odour of the original skin of
which it was made, and this was softened to a musky
fragrance by Louise's favourite perfume, heliotrope. Lazare,
who was very susceptible to the influence of odours, was
violently agitated by that scent, and in a state of emotion
had lingered with the glove pressed to his lips, draining from
it a draught of sweet recollections.</p>

<p>From that day onward he began to yearn for Louise over
the yawning chasm which his mother's death had left within
him. He had never indeed forgotten the girl; her image had
been dimmed somewhat by his grief, but it only wanted that
little thing that had once belonged to her to bring her back
to his mind. He took up the glove again, as soon as he was
alone, kissed it, inhaled its scent, and fancied that he was still
holding the girl in his embrace with his lips seeking hers.
His nervous excitement, the mental feverishness which resulted
from his long-continued inactivity, tended to intensify
this species of intoxication. He felt vexed with himself on
account of it, but he succumbed to it again and again, carried
away by a passion which quite overpowered him. All this,
too, increased his gloomy moodiness, and he even began to
get snappish and surly with his cousin, as though she were in
some way to blame for his passionate trances. Often, in the
midst of some tranquil conversation, he would suddenly rush
off and shut himself up in his room and wallow in his passionate
recollections of the other girl. Then he would come
downstairs again, weary and disgusted with life.</p>

<p>At the end of a month he had so completely changed that
Pauline grew quite hopeless and spent nights of torment. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
the daytime she forced herself to assume a brave face, and kept
herself perpetually busy in the house of which she was now the
mistress. But at night, when she had closed the door of her
room behind her, she dwelt upon her troubles, gave way
completely, and wept like a child. She had no hope left; all her
kindliness only met with an increasingly chilling reception.
Could it really be, she wondered, that kindness and affection
were insufficient, and that it was possible to love a person and
yet cause him unhappiness? For she saw that her cousin was
really unhappy, and she began to fear that it might somehow
be her own fault. And then, beneath her doubts of herself,
there lurked increasing fears of a rival influence. She had
for a long time explained Lazare's gloomy moodiness to herself
as springing from grief at his mother's death; but now
she was again haunted by the idea of Louise, an idea which
had occurred to her on the very day after Madame Chanteau's
death, but which she had then scornfully dismissed amidst
her pride in the power of her own affection, though every
night now it forced itself upon her as she found the efforts of
her love so unavailing.</p>

<p>The girl was haunted by it all. As soon as she had put
down her candle after entering her room she threw herself
upon her bed, without having the energy to undress. All the
gaiety of spirit which she had shown during the day, all her
calmness and restraint, weighed upon her like a too heavy
gown. The day, like those which had preceded it, and like
those which would follow, had passed away amidst that feeling
of hopelessness with which Lazare's moody <i>ennui</i> contaminated
the whole house. What was the use of striving to
appear bright and cheerful, when she was unable to cast a
gleam of sunshine on him she so dearly loved? Lazare's
former cruel remark still rankled in her heart. They were too
lonely, and it was her jealousy that was to blame for it; it
was she who had sent their friends away. She would not
name Louise to herself, and she tried not to think about her;
but she could not succeed in banishing the memory of that
girl, with the winning ways and coquettish airs which had
amused Lazare, who grew bright at the mere rustling of her
gown. The minutes glided on, and still Pauline could not
drive Louise from her thoughts. She felt sure it was for her
that Lazare was anxiously longing, that all that was wanted
to set him right again was to send for the girl. And every
evening when Pauline went upstairs and threw herself
wearily on her bed she relapsed into those same thoughts and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
visions, and was tortured by the idea that the happiness of her
dear ones depended perhaps upon another than herself.</p>

<p>Now and then her spirit would rise within her in rebellion,
and she would spring from her bed, rush to the window and
open it, feeling suffocated. And there, gazing out into the far-spreading
darkness, above the ocean, whose moaning rose to
her ear, she would remain for hours, leaning on her elbows,
unable to sleep, while the sea-air played upon her burning
breast. No; never could she be vile enough, she told herself,
to tolerate that girl's return! Had she not surprised them
together? Was it not an act of treason&mdash;treason of the basest
kind&mdash;that they had committed? Yes; it was an unpardonable
offence, and she would only be making herself their
accomplice if she did anything to bring them together again.
She grew feverish and excited with angry jealousy at the
ideas which she called up, and shook with sobs as she hid
her face with her bare arms. The night sped on, and the
breezes fanned her neck and played with her hair without
calming the angry pulsing of her blood. But even in those
moments when indignation most mastered her, her natural
kindliness still made its voice heard and struggled against her
passion. It whispered to her in gentle tones of the blessedness
of charity, of the sweetness of sacrificing one's self for others.
She tried to hush that inner voice, telling herself that to
carry self-sacrifice to the point of baseness was idiotic; but
she still heard its pleading, which refused to be silenced. By
degrees she grew to recognise it as the voice of her own
better nature, and she began to ask herself what, after all,
would suffering matter, if she could only secure the happiness
of those who were dear to her? Then she sobbed less
loudly as she listened to the moans of the sea ascending
through the darkness, weary and ill the while, and not yet
conquered.</p>

<p>One night, after long weeping at her window, she at last
got into bed. As soon as she had blown out her candle and
lay staring into the darkness she came to a sudden resolution.
The very first thing in the morning she would get
her uncle to write to Louise and invite her to stay at Bonneville
for a month. It all seemed quite natural and easy to her
just then, and she quickly fell into sound sleep, a deeper and
calmer sleep than she had known for weeks. But when she
came down to breakfast the next morning and saw herself
sitting between her uncle and cousin at the family table, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
came a sudden choking sensation in her throat, and she felt
all her courage and resolution forsaking her.</p>

<p>'You are eating nothing,' said Chanteau. 'What's the
matter with you?'</p>

<p>'Nothing at all,' she replied. 'On the contrary, I have
had a remarkably good sleep.'</p>

<p>The mere sight of Lazare brought her back to her mental
struggle. He was eating in silence, weary already of the new
day that had begun, and the girl could not bring herself to
yield him to another. The thought of another taking him
from her, and kissing, him to console and comfort him, was
intolerable to her. Yet when he left the room she made an
effort to carry out her resolution.</p>

<p>'Are your hands any worse to-day?' she asked her uncle.</p>

<p>He gazed at his hands, where tophus was again appearing,
and he painfully bent the joints.</p>

<p>'No,' he answered. 'My right hand is even more supple
than usual. If the priest comes, we'll have a game at
draughts.'</p>

<p>Then, after a moment's silence, he added:</p>

<p>'What makes you ask?'</p>

<p>She had been hoping that he would not be able to write,
and now she blushed deeply, and, like a coward, determined
to defer the letter till the morrow.</p>

<p>'Oh! I only wanted to know!' she stammered.</p>

<p>From that day forward all rest deserted her. Up in her
own room at nights, after her fits of tears, she used to gain the
mastery over herself, and vow that she would dictate to her
uncle a letter in the morning; but when the morning came,
and she again joined in the family life amongst those she
loved, all her resolution failed her. The most trivial little
details sent a pang through her heart; the bread that she cut
for her cousin, his shoes which she gave to Véronique to be
cleaned, and all the petty incidents of the daily routine. They
might surely still be very happy by themselves in their old
way, she thought. What was the use of calling in a stranger?
Why disturb the affectionate life which they had been
living for so many years past? The thought that it would no
longer be she herself who would cut the bread and mend the
linen made her choke with grief, as if she saw all happiness
crumble away. This torture, which lurked in every little
homely detail of her work, made all her duties as mistress a
torment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>

<p>'What can be wrong?' she would sometimes ask herself
aloud. 'We love each other, and yet we are not happy. Our
affection for each other only seems to make us wretched.'</p>

<p>It was a problem she was constantly trying to solve. Perhaps
all the trouble arose from the fact that her own character
and that of her cousin did not harmonize. But, though
she would willingly have adapted herself, have abdicated all
personal will, she found it impossible to do so, for her sense
of reason prevented her. Her patience often gave way, and
there were days of sulking. She would have liked to be
merry and drown all petty wretchedness in gaiety, but she
could no longer do so; she, in her turn, was growing
moody and despondent.</p>

<p>'It's very nice and pleasant this!' Véronique began to
repeat from morning till night. 'There are only three of you
now, and you'll end by eating each other up! Madame used
to have her bad days, but, at any rate, while she was alive,
you managed to keep off banging things at each other's
heads.'</p>

<p>Chanteau himself also began to suffer from the influence
of this slow and, to him, inexplicable disintegration of the
family affections. Whenever he now had an attack of the
gout, he bellowed, as the servant said, more loudly than before,
and his caprices and violence tormented everyone in the
place. The whole house was becoming a hell once more.</p>

<p>At last Pauline, in the last throes of her jealousy, began
to ask herself if she was to impose her own ideas of happiness
on Lazare. Certainly before everything else it was his happiness
that she desired, even at the cost of grief to herself.
Why, then, should she go on keeping him in this seclusion,
in a solitude which seemed to make him suffer? He must,
and doubtless he did, still love her, and he would come back
to her when he was better able to appreciate her after comparison
with that other girl. But, any way, she ought to let
him make his own choice. It was only just, and the idea of
justice remained paramount within her.</p>

<p>Every three months Pauline repaired to Caen to receive the
dividends. She started in the morning and returned in the
evening, after attending to a list of purchases and errands
which she compiled during the previous quarter. On her
visit to Caen in June that year, however, the family vainly
awaited her return, putting off dinner till nine o'clock.
Chanteau, who had become very uneasy, sent Lazare off along<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
the road, fearing that some accident had occurred; whereas
Véronique, with an air of perfect tranquillity, said that it was
foolish of them to distress themselves, for Mademoiselle Pauline,
finding herself behindhand, and being anxious to complete
her purchases, had doubtless determined to stay at Caen all
night. Nevertheless, they spent a very uneasy time at Bonneville,
and next morning, as soon as breakfast was over, their
anxiety returned. About noon, when Chanteau could scarcely
keep himself any longer in his chair, and Lazare had just
determined to set off to Arromanches, Véronique, who had
been standing on the road, suddenly rushed into the room
exclaiming:</p>

<p>'Here she is! Mademoiselle is coming!'</p>

<p>Chanteau insisted upon having his chair wheeled on to
the terrace, and the father and son waited there together,
while Véronique gave them particulars of what she had
seen.</p>

<p>'It was Malivoire's coach. I could tell it was Mademoiselle
Pauline by her crape ribbons. But what I couldn't
understand was that there seemed to be somebody with her.
What can that broken-winded old hack be doing, I wonder?'</p>

<p>At last the coach drove up to the door. Lazare had
stepped towards it, and had already opened his mouth to
question Pauline, who had sprung down lightly, when he
remained as if thunderstruck. Behind his cousin there
appeared another young woman, dressed in striped lilac silk.
Both girls were laughing together in the most friendly fashion.
The young man's surprise was so great that he returned to
his father, crying:</p>

<p>'She has brought Louise with her!'</p>

<p>'Louise! Ah, that's a capital idea!' Chanteau exclaimed.</p>

<p>And when the girls stood side by side before him, the
one still in her deep mourning and the other in her gay
summer toilette, he continued, delighted with this new
distraction:</p>

<p>'Ah, so you have made peace! Well, I never quite
understood what was the matter&mdash;some nonsense, I suppose.
How naughty it was of you, my poor Louisette, to keep
estranged from us during all the trouble we've been through!
Well! it's all at an end now, eh?'</p>

<p>A feeling of embarrassment kept the girls silent. They
blushed and avoided looking at each other. Then Louise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
stepped forward and kissed Chanteau to hide her confusion.
But he wanted some explanations.</p>

<p>'You met each other, I suppose.'</p>

<p>Thereupon Louise turned towards her friend, while her
eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>'It was Pauline who came to see us. I was just going
back into the house myself when she arrived. You mustn't
scold her for staying the night with us, for it was my fault.
I made her stay. And, as the telegraph goes no further than
Arromanches, we thought we should get here ourselves
as soon as any message. Do you forgive me?'</p>

<p>She kissed Chanteau again with all her old caressing
manner. He inquired no further. When what happened
contributed to his pleasure, he had no fault to find with it.</p>

<p>'But there's Lazare,' he added; 'aren't you going to
speak to him?'</p>

<p>The young man had kept in the background, with an
embarrassed smile on his face. His father's remark completed
his confusion, the more especially as Louise only
blushed again and made no step towards him. Why was she
there, he asked himself? Why had his cousin brought back
this rival, whom she had so violently driven away? He
had not yet recovered from his confusion at the sight of
her.</p>

<p>'Kiss her, Lazare!' said Pauline softly, 'since she is too
timid to kiss you.'</p>

<p>Her face was quite white, as she stood there in her deep
mourning, but her expression was perfectly peaceful, and her
eyes clear and untroubled. She looked at them both with
the maternal, serious expression which she assumed in her
graver moments of household responsibility, and only smiled
when the young man took courage to let his lips just touch
the cheek which Louise offered him.</p>

<p>When Véronique saw this, she rushed away and shut
herself up in her kitchen, perfectly thunderstruck. It was
altogether beyond her comprehension. After all that had
passed, Mademoiselle Pauline could have very little heart.
She was becoming quite ridiculous in her desire to please
others. It wasn't sufficient to bring all the dirty little drabs
of the neighbourhood into the house and put them in the
way of walking off with the silver, but now she must bring
sweethearts for Monsieur Lazare! The house was getting
into a nice state indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>When she had vented a little of her indignation in this
explosion over her fire, she went out on to the terrace again,
exclaiming, 'Don't you know that lunch has been ready for
more than an hour? The potatoes are fried to cinders!'</p>

<p>They all ate with good appetites, but Chanteau was the
only one whose mirth flowed freely, and fortunately he was
too gay to notice the persistent constraint of the others.
Though they showed themselves very affectionate, still,
beneath it all, there lurked a touch of that uneasy sadness
which manifests itself in one who forgives an irreparable
insult, but cannot altogether forget it. The afternoon was
spent in installing the newcomer in her room. She again
occupied her old quarters on the first floor. If Madame
Chanteau could only have come downstairs to dinner, with
her quick, short step, nothing would have appeared changed
in the house.</p>

<p>For nearly a week longer this uneasy constraint lasted
amongst the young people. Lazare, who did not dare to
question Pauline, was altogether unable to understand what
he considered her most extraordinary caprice; for any idea
of a sacrifice, of a determination deliberately and magnanimously
taken, never occurred to him. He himself, amidst
the desires fanned by his listless idleness, had never thought
of marrying Louise; and so now, on being all three placed
together again, they found themselves in a false position,
which caused them much distress. There were pauses of
silent embarrassment, and sentences that remained half
unspoken from fear of conveying any allusion to the past.
Pauline, surprised at this unexpected state of affairs, was
obliged to exaggerate and force her gaiety, in the hope of
bringing back a semblance of the careless merriment of
former days. At first she felt a wave of joy rising in her
heart, for she thought that Lazare was coming back to
her. The presence of Louise had calmed him; he almost
avoided her, and shunned being alone with her, horrified
at the thought that he might even yet be weak enough
to betray his cousin's confidence. Tortured by a feverish
affection for Pauline, he attached himself to her, and in tones
of emotion proclaimed her to be the best of girls, a true saint,
of whom he was utterly unworthy. And so she felt very
happy, and rejoiced greatly in what she thought was her
victory, when she saw her cousin pay such little attention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Louise. At the end of the week she even began to reproach
him for his want of amiability towards her rival.</p>

<p>'Why do you always run off and leave us? It really
quite vexes me. She isn't here for us to be rude to her.'</p>

<p>Lazare avoided replying, making only a vague gesture.
Then his cousin ventured to make an allusion to what had
previously happened:</p>

<p>'I brought her here so that you might know that I have
long ago forgiven you. I wanted to wipe out every remembrance
of it, as though it were all some horrid dream. It is
done with now. I am no longer afraid, you see. I have
perfect confidence in you both.'</p>

<p>At this he caught her in his arms. Then he promised to
be courteous and amiable with Louise.</p>

<p>From that moment they spent their days in delightful
intimacy. Lazare no longer seemed to suffer from <i>ennui</i>.
Instead of shutting himself up in his room at the top of the
house, like a recluse, and making himself ill with very loneliness,
he invented amusements and arranged long walks,
from which they came back home glowing, invigorated by
the fresh air. And it was now that Louise by slow degrees
began to recover all her old sway over him. The young
man grew quite at his ease with her again, and once more
offered his arm, and allowed himself to be thrilled afresh by
that disturbing perfume which every fold of the girl's lace
seemed to exhale. At first he struggled against her growing
influence over him, and tried to escape from her as soon as
he found himself becoming intoxicated with her witchery.
But Pauline herself bade him go to the girl's assistance
when they had to leap over a pool as they skirted the shore.
She herself jumped over it boldly, like a boy, disdaining
all help; whereas Louise, with a soft cry like that of a
wounded lark, surrendered herself to the young man's arms.
Then, as they returned home again, and he supported her,
all the low laughter and whispered confidences of former
days began anew. But Pauline was, as yet, in no way
distressed by this; she maintained her brave expression,
without guessing that she was risking her happiness by never
feeling weary or requiring the assistance of her cousin's arm.
It was with a kind of smiling bravado that she made the
others walk in front of her, arm-in-arm, as though she
wanted to show them how great was her confidence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither Lazare nor Louise, indeed, had the slightest
idea of taking advantage of the trust she reposed in them.
Though the young man was again bewitched by Louise, he
perpetually struggled against her influence and made a point
of showing himself more affectionate than before to his
cousin. In Louise's society, whilst ever finding some charm
by which he allowed himself to be deliciously beguiled, he
was always protesting to himself that this time the game
should not go beyond the limits of permissible flirtation.
Why, he asked himself, should he deny himself some pleasant
little amusement, since he was quite determined to go no
further? Louise, too, felt more scruples than formerly;
not that she accused herself of previous coquetry, for she
was naturally of a caressing disposition, but now she would
neither have done nor said anything that she thought might
be in the least degree distasteful to Pauline. Her friend's
forgiveness of what had passed had moved her to tears.
She wanted to show that she was worthy of it, and seemed
to regard her with that exuberant feminine adoration
which finds expression in vows and kisses and all kinds of
passionate caresses. She kept a constant watch upon her, so
that she might run up to her at the first appearance of displeasure.
At times she would abruptly leave Lazare's arm
for Pauline's, and try to enliven her, and even pretend to
sulk with the young man. Never before had Louise appeared
so charming as she did now in this constant state of emotion,
which arose from the necessity she felt of pleasing both
Pauline and Lazare; and the whole house seemed alive with
the rustle of her skirts and her pretty wheedling ways.</p>

<p>Little by little, however, Pauline became quite wretched
again. Her temporary hope and momentary feeling of
triumph only served to increase her pain. She no longer
experienced the violent paroxysms and wild outbursts of
jealousy which had once quite distracted her. Hers was
rather a sensation of having life slowly crushed out of
her, as though some heavy mass had fallen on her with a
weight which bore her down more and more each passing
minute. She felt that everything was over, that hope was no
longer possible for her. And yet she had no reasonable ground
of complaint against the two others. They showed the
greatest thoughtfulness and affection for her, and struggled
earnestly against the influences which attracted them towards
each other. But it was this very show of affection which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
especially tortured her, for she began to see that they were
prompted by a desire to prevent her from feeling pained by
their love for one another. The pity of those young lovers
was unendurable to her. When she left them together, were
there not soft confessions and rapid whisperings, and then,
when she joined them again, a sudden relapse into silence,
after which Louise lavished kisses upon her and Lazare
evinced affectionate humility? She would have preferred to
know that they were really in the wrong, for all those honourable
scruples and compensatory caresses, which plainly told
her the real truth, left her quite disarmed, with neither the
will nor the energy to try to win back her own happiness. On
the day when she had brought her rival to Bonneville she had
intended to hold her own against her, if she found any struggle
necessary; but what could she do against a couple of children
whose love for each other was such a source of distress to
them? It was her own doing, too; she might have married
Lazare, had she chosen, without troubling herself about his
possible preference for someone else. But, in spite of her
jealous torments, her heart rebelled against the idea of exacting
from him the fulfilment of his promise&mdash;a promise which he no
doubt now regretted. Though it should kill her to do so, she
would give him up rather than marry him if he loved another.</p>

<p>Meanwhile she still went on playing the part of mother to
her little family; nursing Chanteau, who was not going on
very satisfactorily, soothing Véronique, whose sense of propriety
was seriously offended, to say nothing of pretending to
treat Lazare and Louise as a pair of disorderly children in
order that she might be able to smile at their escapades. She
succeeded in forcing herself to laugh even more loudly than
they did, with that clear, ringing laugh of hers, whose limpid
notes testified to her healthy courage. The whole house
seemed gay and animated. She herself affected a bustling
activity from morning till night, refusing to accompany the
young couple in their walks, on the pretence that she had to
undertake a general cleaning of the house, or see after the
washing, or superintend the making of preserves. It was, however,
more particularly Lazare who had now become noisy and
energetic. He went whistling up and down the stairs,
drummed on the doors, and found the days too short and uneventful.
Although he did not actually do anything, his
new passion seemed to find him more occupation than he
had either time or strength for. Once more he intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
conquer the world, and every day at dinner he expounded fresh
extraordinary schemes for the future. He had already grown
disgusted with the idea of literature, and had abandoned all
notion of reading for the examinations which he had intended
to pass in order to enable him to take up a professorship. For
a long time he had made this intention of studying an excuse
for shutting himself up in solitude in his room; but he had
there felt so discouraged that he had never opened a book,
and now he began to scoff at his own foolishness in ever contemplating
such a thing. Could anything be more idiotic
than to chain himself down to a life like that in order to be
able at some future time to write a lot of plays and novels?
No! Politics alone were worthy of his ambition; and he had
now quite made up his mind. He had a slight acquaintance
with the Deputy for Caen, and he would go with him to Paris
as his secretary, and, doubtless, in a few months' time he
would make his way. The Empire was in great want of
intelligent young men.</p>

<p>When Pauline, whom this wild whirl of ideas made uneasy,
tried to calm his ambitious fever by advising him to
look out for some smaller but safer berth, he scoffed at her
prudence and jokingly called her 'an old grandmother.'</p>

<p>One day, when Lazare and Louise had gone by themselves
to Verchemont, Pauline had need of a recipe for freshening
some old velvet; and she went upstairs to search for it in her
cousin's big wardrobe, where she thought she recollected
having seen it on a scrap of paper between the pages of a book.
While she was looking for it she discovered amongst some
pamphlets Louise's old glove, that forgotten glove, the contemplation
of which had so often filled Lazare with intoxication.
It proved a ray of light to Pauline. She recognised in it the
object which her cousin had hidden from her with such
emotion that evening when she had suddenly entered his
room to tell him that dinner was ready. She fell upon a
chair, quite overcome by the revelation. Ah! he had been
longing for that girl before ever she had returned to the house;
he had lived on his recollections of her, and he had worn that
glove away with his lips because it retained some scent of her
person! Pauline's whole body was shaken by sobs, while
her streaming eyes remained fixed upon the glove, which she
held in her trembling hands.</p>

<p>'Well, Mademoiselle, have you found it yet?' called
Véronique, who had just come upstairs from the landing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
'The best thing you can do is to rub the stuff with a piece of
bacon-rind.'</p>

<p>She came into the room, and seemed quite amazed at finding
Pauline in tears, with her fingers clutching the old glove.
But as she glanced round the room she at last guessed the
cause of the girl's despair.</p>

<p>'Well! well!' she said, in the rough way that was
becoming more and more habitual to her, 'you might have
expected it! I warned you how it would be, long ago. You
brought them together again, and now they amuse themselves.
And perhaps my mistress was right, after all; that kitten of a
girl brightens him up more than you do.'</p>

<p>Then she shook her head, and added in a grave voice, as
though she was speaking to herself:</p>

<p>'Ah! my mistress had a very clear eyesight, in spite of her
faults. For my part, I can't bring myself to think that she is
really dead.'</p>

<p>That evening, when Pauline had locked herself in her room
and placed her candlestick on the chest of drawers, she threw
herself upon her bed, repeating that she must get Louise
and Lazare married. All day long a buzzing sensation had
made her head throb and prevented her from thinking clearly;
and it was only now, in the quiet night-time, when she was
able to suffer without witnesses of her trouble, that the inevitable
consequence of what had happened presented itself
clearly to her mind. It was absolutely necessary that Lazare
and Louise should marry. The thought rang through her like
an order, like the voice of reason and justice, to which she could
no longer turn a deaf ear. For a moment she, who was so
courageous, gave way to terror, fancying she heard her dead aunt
calling out to her to obey. Then, all dressed as she was, she
turned over and covered herself with the bed-clothes to drown
the sound of her sobs. Oh! to have to surrender him to another!
To know that another's arms would be clasped round him and
would keep him from her for ever! To lose all hope of ever
winning him back! No! she could never have enough
courage for it; she would prefer to continue leading her
present life of wretchedness. No one at all should have him,
neither herself nor that other girl; and Lazare should grow
old and withered with waiting! For a long time she lay
struggling with herself, racked by jealous fury. Her impetuous
temperament, which neither years nor reflection had been
able to subdue, always asserted itself at the first moment of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
difficulty. Then, however, she became prostrate, physically
exhausted.</p>

<p>Too tired and weary to undress, Pauline lay for a long
time on her back, debating the question. She succeeded in
proving to herself that Louise could do more to secure Lazare's
happiness than she ever could. Had not that girl, so weak
and puny, already roused him from his <i>ennui</i> with her
caresses? Doubtless it was necessary for him to have her
continually clinging to his neck, that she might drive away
with kisses all his gloomy thoughts, his terror of death. Then
Pauline fell to depreciating herself, repeating that she was
too cold and had none of the amorous graces of a woman,
but only kindliness, which was not sufficient allurement. One
other consideration, too, brought her complete conviction. She
was ruined, and her cousin's plans for the future, those plans
which had caused her so much anxiety, would require a large
amount of money for accomplishment. Would it be right for
her to impose on him the narrow, sordid life which they were
now obliged to lead, condemn him to mediocrity, which she
could see was painful to him? Their life together would be
unhappy, poisoned by continual regret, the querulous bitterness
of disappointed ambition. She could only give him a
rancorous life of poverty; whereas Louise, who was wealthy,
could open out to him the great career of which he dreamed.
It was said that the girl's father was keeping some good berth
vacant for his future son-in-law, probably some lucrative
position in the bank; and, though Lazare affected to despise
financiers, matters would no doubt be satisfactorily arranged.
She felt that she could hesitate no longer, now that it seemed
clear to her that she would be committing an unworthy action
if she did not marry them together. And as she lay awake
on her bed, that union of Lazare and Louise seemed to her
to be a necessity, which she must hasten if she wanted to
preserve her own self-respect.</p>

<p>The whole night passed while she was thus wrestling with
herself. When the day broke, she at last undressed. She
was perfectly calm now, and enjoyed profound repose, though
still unable to sleep. She had never before felt so easy, so
satisfied with herself, so free from all anxiety. All was ending;
she had just severed the bonds of egotism, she had no
hopes now centred in any person or thing, and within her
lurked all the subtle pleasure that comes of self-sacrifice. She
did not even experience any longer her old craving to prove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
all-sufficient for the happiness of her people. The pride of
abnegation had vanished, and she was willing that those she
loved should be happy through other instrumentality than her
own. It was the loftiest height which love for others can
reach, to suppress one's self, to give up everything and still
think one has not given enough, to love so deeply as to
rejoice in a happiness which one has neither bestowed nor
shares. The sun was rising when she at last dropped off into
a deep sleep.</p>

<p>Pauline came downstairs very late that morning. When
she awoke, it made her happy to find that all the resolutions
she had taken during the night remained fixed and unwavering
within her. But she began to reflect that she had forgotten
what would become of herself, and that she must make some
plans for her future altered circumstances. Though she
might have the courage to bring about the marriage of Lazare
and Louise, she would certainly never be brave enough to
remain with them and watch their happiness. Self-devotion
has its limits, and she was afraid of some return of her violent
outbursts, some terrible scene which would kill her. Besides,
was she not really doing all that could possibly be demanded of
her, and could anyone have the cruelty to impose useless torture
upon her? She came to an immediate and irrevocable
decision. She would go away, leave the house, which was so
full of disquieting associations. This would mean a complete
change in her life, but she did not shrink from it.</p>

<p>At breakfast she showed a calm cheerfulness, which she
henceforth maintained. She bravely endured the sight of
Lazare and Louise, sitting side by side, whispering and
smiling, without any other feeling of weakness than a chilly
coldness at her heart. As it was Saturday, she made up her
mind to send them out for a long walk together in order that
she might be alone when Doctor Cazenove came. They went
off, and Pauline then took the precaution of going out into the
road to meet the Doctor. As soon as he caught sight of her
he wanted her to get up into his gig and drive to the house
with him. But she begged him to alight, and they walked
along slowly together, while Martin, a hundred yards in the
rear, brought on the empty vehicle.</p>

<p>In a few simple words Pauline unbosomed herself to the
Doctor. She told him everything&mdash;her plan of giving Lazare
to Louise and her determination to leave the house. This
confession had seemed necessary to her; she was unwilling to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
act upon mere inspiration, and the old doctor was the only
person who could understand her.</p>

<p>Cazenove suddenly halted in the middle of the road and
clasped the girl in his long bony arms. He was trembling
with emotion, and he kissed her on the hair, as he said
affectionately:</p>

<p>'You are quite right, my dear; you are quite right. And
it pleases me very much to hear it, for matters might have
had a much worse ending. For months past I have been feeling
grieved, and I was longing to come and talk to you, for I knew
you were very unhappy. Ah! they have plundered you and
stripped you nicely, those good folks! First your money, and
now your heart!'</p>

<p>The young girl tried to stop him.</p>

<p>'My dear friend, I beg you&mdash;&mdash;You are judging them
unfairly.'</p>

<p>'Perhaps so, but that does not prevent me from being
glad on your account. Yes, yes! Give up your Lazare! It
is not a very valuable present that you are making to the
other one! I daresay that he is a very charming fellow, and
that he has the best intentions in the world; but I prefer that
the other should be unhappy with him, and not you. Those
fine fellows who grow bored with everything are far too heavy
even for broad shoulders like yours to support. I would
rather see you marry some sturdy butcher-lad&mdash;yes, I mean
it&mdash;some butcher-lad who would shake his sides day and night
with honest, merry laughter.'</p>

<p>Then, as he saw her eyes fill with tears, he added:</p>

<p>'Ah, well! you love him, I suppose, and so I won't say
anything more. Give me a kiss again, since you are brave
enough to act so sensibly. Ah! what a fool he is not to see
what he is doing!'</p>

<p>He took her arm and drew her close to his side. Then
they began to talk seriously together as they resumed their
walk. The Doctor told her that she would certainly, do best
to leave Bonneville, and he undertook to find her a situation.
He happened, he said, to have a rich old relative living at
Saint-Lô, who was looking for a young lady companion.
Pauline would be perfectly happy with her, and very likely the
old lady, who had no children of her own, would grow much
attached to her and subsequently adopt her. They arranged
everything between themselves, and the Doctor promised
Pauline a definite reply from his relative in a few days' time.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
Meanwhile it was settled she should say nothing about
her determination to leave the Chanteaus. She was afraid
that if she did it might seem to be in some way a threat, and
she was anxious to bring the marriage to an issue and then
immediately leave the house like one who could no longer be
of use there.</p>

<p>On the third day Pauline received a letter from the Doctor.
She was expected at Saint-Lô as soon as she could get away.
It was on this same day, during Lazare's absence, that she
led Louise to an old seat beneath a clump of tamarisks at the
bottom of the kitchen garden. In front of them, above the
low wall, they could see nothing but the sea and sky&mdash;a
measureless expanse of blue, intersected by the far-stretching
line of the horizon.</p>

<p>'My dear girl,' said Pauline to Louise with her maternal
air, 'let us talk as though we were two sisters. You love
me a little, don't you?'</p>

<p>Louise threw one arm round her friend's waist as she
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Indeed I do! You know I do!'</p>

<p>'Well, then, since you love me, it was very wrong of you
not to tell me everything. Why do you keep secrets from
me?'</p>

<p>'Indeed, I have no secrets.'</p>

<p>'Ah! yes; think again now. Come, open your heart to
me.'</p>

<p>Each looked into the other's face so closely for a moment
that they felt the warmth of one another's breath. And the
eyes of one gradually grew troubled beneath the clear, unruffled
gaze of the other. The silence was growing painful.</p>

<p>'Tell me everything. When things are discussed openly
it is possible to arrange them satisfactorily, but dissimulation
is apt to have an unhappy ending. Isn't that so, eh? It
would be very painful for us to disagree again and to have a
repetition of what caused us so much grief and trouble.'</p>

<p>At this Louise burst into a violent fit of sobbing. She
clasped Pauline round the waist convulsively, and hid her
face against her friend's shoulder while stammering amidst
her tears:</p>

<p>'Oh! it is very unkind of you to speak of that again!
You ought never to have mentioned it again, never! Send
me away at once, rather than pain me like this!'</p>

<p>It was in vain that Pauline tried to soothe her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>'No, no!' the weeping girl went on; 'I understand it all.
You still suspect me. Why do you speak to me of secrets?
I have no secret at all. I do everything quite openly, so that
you may have no cause to find fault with me or reproach me.
I am not to blame because things happen which disturb you&mdash;I
who am even careful how I laugh, though you don't know
it&mdash;&mdash;But, if you don't believe me, I had better go away
at once. Let me go! Let me go!'</p>

<p>They were quite alone in that far-reaching space. The
kitchen-garden, scorched by the west wind, lay at their feet
like a piece of waste land, while, further away, the calm sea
spread out in its immensity.</p>

<p>'But listen to what I have to say,' Pauline cried. 'I am
not reproaching you at all; on the contrary, I want to encourage
you.'</p>

<p>Then, taking Louise by the shoulders and forcing her to
raise her eyes, she said to her gently, like a mother questioning
her daughter:</p>

<p>'You love Lazare? And he, too, loves you, I am sure.'</p>

<p>The blood surged to Louise's cheeks. She trembled yet
more violently, and tried to liberate herself and escape.</p>

<p>'Good gracious! How clumsily I must express myself if
you can't understand me!' Pauline resumed. 'Do you think
I should talk to you on such a subject only to torture you?
You love each other, don't you? Well, I want to get you
married to one another! It's very simple!'</p>

<p>Louise, distracted, ceased to struggle. Stupor checked
the flow of her tears, rendered her motionless, with her
hands hanging inertly beside her.</p>

<p>'What! And yourself?' she gasped.</p>

<p>'I, my dear? Well, I have been questioning myself very
seriously for some weeks past, at night-time especially, during
those waking hours when one's mind sees things in a clearer
light. And I have recognised that I only feel sincere friendship
for Lazare. Haven't you been able to see as much for
yourself? We are comrades, chums; like a couple of boys, in
fact. We do not feel those loving transports&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She hesitated, trying to find some suitable phrase which
would give an appearance of probability to her falsehoods.
But her rival still gazed at her with fixed eyes, as though she
had discovered the meaning which was hidden beneath her
words.</p>

<p>'Why do you tell me untruths?' she murmured at last.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
'Is it possible for you to cease to love where you have once
loved?'</p>

<p>Pauline grew confused.</p>

<p>'Well! well!' she said; 'what does that matter? You
love each other, and it is quite natural that he should marry
you. I&mdash;I was brought up with him, and I shall continue to
be a sister to him. One's ideas alter when one has been
waiting so long&mdash;&mdash;And, then, there are several other
reasons&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>She was conscious that she was growing more confused,
and, carried away by her frankness, she went on:</p>

<p>'Oh! my dear, let me have my way. If I still love him
sufficiently to want to see him your husband, it is because I
now believe that you are necessary to his happiness. That
doesn't vex you, does it? You would do the same if you were
in my place, would you not? Come, let us talk it over
quietly. Will you join in the little plot? Shall we come to an
understanding together to force him into being happy? Even
if he seems vexed about it and persists in believing that he is
yet bound to me, you must help me to persuade him, for
it is you whom he loves, and it is you who are necessary to
him. Be my accomplice, I beg you, and let us get everything
arranged at once, now, while we are alone.'</p>

<p>But Louise, seeing how she trembled, how heart-broken
she was in making those entreaties, persisted in rebelling.</p>

<p>'No, no! I couldn't think of such a thing! It would be
abominable. You still love him; I am sure of it, and you are
only planning your own torment. Instead of helping you, I will
tell him everything. Yes, as soon as he comes back&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Then Pauline threw her kindly arms round her again to
prevent her from continuing, and drew her face close to her
breast.</p>

<p>'Hold your tongue, you wicked child! It must be so. It
is he whom we have to think about.'</p>

<p>Silence fell again, while they lingered in that embrace.
Her powers of resistance already exhausted, Louise gave way,
yielded with affectionate languor, while tears mounted to her
eyes&mdash;happy tears that trickled slowly down her cheeks. She
spoke no word, but pressed her friend to her, as though she
could find no discreeter or more sincere way of expressing her
gratitude. She recognised that Pauline was so much above her,
so lofty, so self-sacrificing, that she dared not raise her eyes to
meet her gaze. However, after a few minutes, she ventured to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
lift her head in smiling confusion, and then, protruding her
lips, gave her friend a silent kiss. In the distance the sea
stretched out beneath the cloudless sky without a single wave
breaking on its blue immensity.</p>

<p>When Lazare returned to the house, Pauline went up to
him in his room, that big and well-loved chamber where they
had grown up together. She was anxious to finish her task
that very day. With her cousin she sought no preliminary
remarks, but went straight to the point. The room teemed
with associations of their old life. Pieces of dry seaweed still
lay about there, the models of the stockades littered the piano,
and the table was strewn with scientific treatises and scores
of music.</p>

<p>'Lazare,' she began, 'I want to talk to you. I have
something serious to say to you.'</p>

<p>He seemed surprised, and then took his stand before her.</p>

<p>'What is the matter? Is my father threatened with
another attack?'</p>

<p>'No, listen. It is necessary that the subject should now
be mentioned; keeping silence about it cannot do any good.
You know that my aunt intended we should be married.
We have frequently spoken about it, and for months past it:
has been considered a settled matter. Well, I think that it
would now be better if all thought of it were abandoned.'</p>

<p>The young man had turned pale, but he did not allow his
cousin to finish; he exclaimed excitedly:</p>

<p>'What? What nonsense are you talking? Are you not
already my wife? We will go to-morrow, if you like, and ask
the priest to put the finishing-stroke to the matter. And this
is what you call something serious!'</p>

<p>The girl replied in her tranquil voice:</p>

<p>'It is very serious; and, though it displeases you, I repeat
that it is certainly necessary we should speak about it. We
are two old friends and comrades, but I am afraid we should
never be two lovers. So what is the good of obstinately
persisting in an idea which would probably never result in
happiness for either of us?'</p>

<p>Then Lazare burst out into a torrent of ejaculations.
Was she trying to quarrel with him? She couldn't expect
him to spend his whole time clinging round her neck! And,
though the marriage had been put off from month to month,
she knew quite well that it wasn't his fault. It was unjust
of her, moreover, to say that he no longer loved her. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
loved her so warmly, and in that very room too! At this
reference to the past a blush mounted to Pauline's cheeks.
Her cousin was right. She recollected his passing gusts of
passion, and his hot breath fanning her neck. But, ah! how
far off were those delicious thrilling moments; and what an
unimpassioned, brotherly friendship he manifested for her
now! So it was with an expression of sadness that she
replied to him:</p>

<p>'My poor fellow, if you really loved me, instead of arguing
with me as you are doing, you would be clasping me in
your arms and sobbing, and finding some very different way
of persuading me.'</p>

<p>He turned still paler, and threw up his hands with a
vague gesture of protest as he let himself fall upon a chair.</p>

<p>'No!' the girl went on; 'it is quite clear that you love
me no longer. But it can't be helped. We are, no doubt,
not suited to each other. When we were shut up here
together, you were driven into thinking about me. But all
your fancy vanished later on; it did not last, because there
was nothing in me that could keep you to me.'</p>

<p>A final paroxysm of exasperation carried him off, and he
swayed about in his chair as he stammered:</p>

<p>'Well! what do you want? What is the meaning of all
this? I quietly return home, and come up here to put on my
slippers, and then you suddenly fall on me, and without the
least warning launch out into an extravagant harangue&mdash;"I
don't love you any longer"&mdash;"We are not made for one
another"&mdash;"The wedding must be broken off." Once more
I ask you, what is the meaning of it all?'</p>

<p>Pauline, who had drawn near him, slowly answered:</p>

<p>'It means that you love someone else, and that I advise
you to marry her.'</p>

<p>For a moment Lazare remained silent. Then he began to
sneer. Good! They were going to have the old scenes over
again. Everything was going to be turned topsy-turvy once
more by her idiotic jealousy! She couldn't bear to see him
cheerful even for a single day without wanting to banish
everyone away from him.</p>

<p>Pauline listened with an expression of profound grief;
then she suddenly laid her trembling hands upon his
shoulders, and an involuntary cry burst from her heart:</p>

<p>'Oh! my dear, can you believe that I want to distress
you? Can't you see that my only desire is to make you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
happy? I would endure anything to win you a single hour's
happiness. You love Louise; is that not so? Well, I tell
you to marry her. Understand me. I am in the way no
longer. Marry her; I give her to you!'</p>

<p>Her cousin looked at her in amazement. With his
nervous, ill-balanced nature his feelings rushed to extremes
at the slightest impulse. His eyelids quivered, and he burst
into sobs.</p>

<p>'Oh, don't talk like that!' he cried. 'I am utterly worthless!
Yes, indeed, I despise myself bitterly for all that has
happened in this house for years past. I am deeply in your
debt. Don't say I am not! We took your money, I
squandered it like a fool, and now I have sunk so low that
you make me alms of my word and promise, and give them
back to me out of sheer pity, as to a man destitute of courage
and honour!'</p>

<p>'Lazare! Lazare!' she murmured, quite frightened.</p>

<p>But he sprang furiously to his feet and began striding
about the room, drumming on his breast with his fists.</p>

<p>'Leave me! I should kill myself straight off if I treated
myself as I deserve. Do I not owe you my love? Isn't it a
disgrace and an abomination for me to wish for that other
girl, who was not meant for me and isn't nearly so good or so
pretty as you are? When a man descends to conduct like
this, there must be mud in his soul! You see that I am
hiding nothing from you, that I am not attempting to defend
myself. Listen to me! Rather than accept your sacrifice, I
would myself turn Louise out of the house, and then go off to
America and never see either of you again!'</p>

<p>For a long time Pauline tried to calm him and reason
with him. Couldn't he try for once, she asked, to take life
as it was, without any exaggeration? Couldn't he see that the
advice she offered him was good advice, resolved upon after
long deliberation? The marriage she advocated would be
good for everyone. She was able to speak of it in such calm
tones because, far from the thought of it paining her, she
now sincerely wished it. Then, carried away by her desire
to convince him, she unfortunately made an allusion to
Louise's fortune, and hinted that Thibaudier, when the
marriage had taken place, would certainly find some post for
his son-in-law.</p>

<p>'Ah! that's it!' he broke out violently. 'You want to
sell me now! Say plainly that I can no longer care for you,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
because I have ruined you, and that it only remains for me
to be base enough to marry a rich girl. No, no, indeed; that
is too mean and degrading! Never will I do it&mdash;never! Do
you hear me? Never!'</p>

<p>Pauline, whose strength was exhausted, ceased her entreaties.
Silence reigned. Lazare had thrown himself on
the chair again, while the girl paced slowly up and down
the big room, lingering before each piece of furniture. Those
old familiar things, the table which she had worn away with
the pressure of her elbows, the wardrobe where her childish
playthings were still stowed away, all the old souvenirs
littered about the room, made a feeling of hope, which she
strove to dismiss, spring up in her heart&mdash;a hope whose sweetness,
in spite of herself, gradually thrilled her. Suppose he
did really love her sufficiently to refuse to take another! But
she knew too well the weak morrows that followed his
passionate outbursts of sentiment. Besides, it was very weak
of her to harbour hope, and she must guard against allowing
herself to yield to his nerveless vacillating nature.</p>

<p>'You must think it all over,' she said in conclusion, as
she stopped short before him. 'I won't bother you any more
at present. I am sure you will be more reasonable in the
morning.'</p>

<p>The next day, however, was passed in painful constraint.
The house once more seemed to be under the depressing
influence of a vague bitter sorrow. Louise's eyes were red,
and Lazare avoided her and spent whole hours by himself in
his room. But again the days went on; the constraint
began to disappear, and laughter and whispering once
more came back. Pauline still waited, indulging in foolish
hopes even against her own convictions. Backed by uncertainty,
she thought that she had never before really known
what suffering was. But, at last, as she was going down to
the kitchen one evening in the dusk to get a candle, she
found Lazare and Louise kissing each other in the passage.
Louise made her escape laughing; while Lazare, emboldened
by the darkness, caught hold of Pauline and imprinted two
brotherly kisses on her cheeks.</p>

<p>'I have thought it over,' he murmured. 'You are better
and wiser than she is; and I still love you, but I love you as
I loved my mother.'</p>

<p>She had just strength to say:</p>

<p>'It is settled, then. I am very glad.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>She felt that she had turned so pale, and her face was so
cold, that she dared not go into the kitchen for fear she should
faint. Without waiting to get a candle, she went upstairs
again, saying that she had forgotten something. When she
had shut herself up in the darkness, she thought she was
going to die, for she felt suffocated, and could not shed a
single tear. What had she done, she cried to herself, that
he should have been cruel enough to make her torture still
greater? Why couldn't he have accepted her sacrifice on the
day when she proposed it to him, when she had possessed all
her strength, unweakened by any false hope? Now the
sacrifice had become a double one. She had lost him a
second time, and all the more painfully since she had
allowed herself to hope that she was winning him back.
Ah, Heaven! She would be brave and bear it, but it was
wicked to make her task such torture.</p>

<p>Everything was speedily arranged. Véronique, quite
aghast, could make nothing out of it. She thought that
things had got turned upside down since her mistress's death.
It was, however, Chanteau who was most surprised by the
news. He, who usually took no interest in anything and just
nodded his head in approval of any scheme that was mentioned
to him, as though he were completely absorbed in
the selfish enjoyment of the calm moments which he stole
from his tormenting pain, burst into tears when Pauline
herself announced the new arrangement to him. He gazed
at her, and stammered incoherent protests and confessions.
It wasn't his fault: he had wanted to do very differently
long ago, both about the money and about the marriage, but,
as she knew, he was too ill. However, the girl kissed him,
protesting that it was she herself who was making Lazare
marry Louise for very good reasons. At first he could
scarcely believe her, and, blinking his eyes sadly, he asked
her:</p>

<p>'Is that really the truth? Really?'</p>

<p>Then, when he saw her smile, he quickly consoled himself
and grew quite gay. It was a great relief to have
things settled, for the matter had long been distressing him,
though he had never dared to open his mouth about it. He
kissed Louise on the cheeks, and in the evening, over the
dessert, he sang a merry song. Just as he was going to bed,
however, he was troubled by a last disquieting thought.</p>

<p>'You will stay with us, eh?' he asked Pauline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl hesitated for a moment, and then, blushing at
her falsehood, she answered, 'Oh! no doubt.'</p>

<p>A whole month was required for the completion of the
necessary formalities. Thibaudier, Louise's father, had,
however, at once consented to the proposal of Lazare, who
was his godson. There was only one dispute between them,
a couple of days before the wedding, when the young man
roundly refused to go to Paris and manage an Insurance
Company, in which the banker was the principal shareholder.
He intended remaining for a year or two longer at Bonneville
and writing a novel, which was to be a masterpiece,
before he started off to bring Paris to his feet. At this
Thibaudier just shrugged his shoulders, and in a friendly
way called him a big simpleton.</p>

<p>It was arranged that the marriage should take place at
Caen. During the previous fortnight there were continual
comings and goings, a perfect fever of journeyings. Pauline
went about with Louise, seeking to divert her thoughts
with all the bustle, and returning home quite exhausted.
As Chanteau was not able to leave Bonneville, she had to
promise to attend the ceremony, at which she would be the
only representative of her cousin's family. The near approach
of the day filled her with terror. She had arranged
that she would not spend the night at Caen, for she thought
she would suffer less if she returned to sleep at Bonneville.
She pretended that her uncle's health made her very uneasy,
and that she was unwilling to remain long away from him.
Chanteau himself vainly pressed her to spend a few days at
Caen. He wasn't ill at all, he urged. On the contrary, he was
very much excited by the idea of the approaching wedding
and the thought of the banquet at which he would not be
present; and he was craftily planning to make Véronique
supply him with some forbidden dish, such as a young
truffled partridge, which he could never eat without the
absolute certainty of a fresh attack of gout. However, in
spite of all that could be urged, the girl declared that she
would return home in the evening. She thought that this
course would allow her greater facilities for packing her
trunk the next morning and disappearing.</p>

<p>A drizzling rain was falling, and midnight had just struck
as Malivoire's old coach brought Pauline back to Bonneville
on the evening of the wedding. Wearing a blue silk gown,
and ill protected by a little shawl, she was pale and shivering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
though her hands were hot. In the kitchen she found
Véronique sitting up for her and dozing beside the table.
The tall flame of the candle made the girl's eyes blink, full
as they still were of the darkness of the journey, during
which they had remained wide open all the way from
Arromanches. She could only drag a few incoherent words
from the drowsy servant: the master had been very foolish,
but he was asleep now, and nobody had called. Then Pauline
took a candle and went upstairs, chilled by the emptiness
of the house, heart-sick amidst all the gloom and silence
which seemed to weigh upon her shoulders.</p>

<p>When she reached the second floor she wished to take
immediate refuge in her own room, but an irresistible
impulse, at which she felt surprised, led her to open Lazare's
door. She raised her candle to enable her to see, as though
she fancied the room was full of smoke. Nothing was
changed. Every piece of furniture was in its accustomed
place, but she felt conscious of calamity, annihilation; it was
a vague terror, as though she were in some chamber of
death. She slowly walked up to the table and looked at the
inkstand, the pen, and an unfinished page of manuscript
still lying there. Then she went away. All was over, and
the door closed on the echoing emptiness of the room.</p>

<p>When she reached her own chamber, the same vague
sensation of strangeness that she had felt in Lazare's again
affected her. Could this indeed be her room, with its wall-paper
of blue roses and its little muslin-curtained iron bed?
Was it really here that she had lived so many years? Still
keeping her candle in her hand, she, who was usually so
courageous, made a minute inspection of the apartment,
pushed the curtains aside, looked under the bed and behind
the furniture. She felt overcome by a strange kind of stupor,
which kept her standing in front of the different things. She
could not have believed that such keen anguish could ever
have possessed her beneath that ceiling, whose every stain
was familiar to her; and she now began to regret that she
had not stayed at Caen. For she felt frightened in that old
house, which was so empty and yet so full of memories of the
past, and so cold, too, and so dark that stormy night. The
thought of going to bed was intolerable to her. She sat
down without even taking off her hat, and for several minutes
remained motionless, her eyes fixed upon the candle-flame,
which dazzled them. Suddenly, however, she started up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
astonishment. What was she doing there, with her head
throbbing wildly, with a violence that quite prevented her
from thinking? It was one o'clock. She ought to be in
bed. And she began to undress with slow, feverish hands.</p>

<p>Her orderly habits showed themselves even in this crisis
of her life. She carefully put away her hat, and glanced
anxiously at her boots to see if they had sustained any
damage. She had folded her dress and laid it over the back
of a chair, when her glance fell upon her bosom. Gradually
a flush crimsoned her cheeks. In her troubled brain arose
the thought of those two others over yonder. Alas! the
harvest of love was not for her! To another were given the
embraces of that husband for whose coming she herself had
looked forward for so many years! Never would she be a
wife or mother; the years would come and go, and she would
age in utter loneliness. Then wild jealousy came upon her.
She yearned to live, to live to the full, to drain the joys of
life, she who loved life so dearly! She was more beautiful
than that scraggy, fair-haired girl; she was stronger and
healthier, and yet her cousin had not chosen her. Never
now would he be hers; never, as in the past, might she again
wait for him, expect him. She was tossed aside like an old
rag. It was, no doubt, her own doing; and yet how awful
was the thought of the others being together while she was
all alone, shivering with fever in that cold, gloomy house!</p>

<p>Suddenly she threw herself on her bed. She seized the
pillow with desperate hands, and bit it with her teeth to
stifle her sobs. Long convulsive shivers shook her from head
to heels. It was in vain that she closed her eyelids, seeking
to shut out all sight; she saw just the same, and ever
endured torture. Oh! what was she to do? Even if she
were to tear her eyes out she would still see&mdash;see perhaps for
ever.</p>

<p>The minutes glided on, and she was only conscious of
everlasting torment. A paroxysm of fear made her spring to
her feet. Some one must be in the room, for surely she had
heard the sound of laughter. But she found that it was only
her candle, which, having nearly burnt out, had broken the
glass socket. Yet if anyone really had seen her! That
imaginary laugh still coursed through her wildly. Then at
last she slipped on a night-dress and hastily buried herself
in bed, pulling up the clothes to her chin, and drawing her
shivering body as closely together as possible. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
candle died out, she lay perfectly still, exhausted and overcome
with shame for her wild conduct.</p>

<p>In the morning Pauline packed her trunk, but she could
not summon up courage to tell Chanteau of her departure.
In the evening, however, she was obliged to inform him of it,
for Doctor Cazenove was to come the next day and take her to
his relative's house. When her uncle grasped the situation
he was quite overcome, and stretched out his poor, weak
hands with a wild gesture as though to detain her, while
in broken, stammering sentences he besought her to stay with
him. She could surely never really think of such a thing, he
cried; she could not possibly desert him; it would be a murder,
for it would certainly kill him. Then, seeing her gently
resolute and divining her reasons, he confessed his wrong-doing
of the previous day in eating a partridge. He already experienced
sharp burning pains in his joints. It was always
the same old story. He had yielded once more in the struggle.
He knew what the consequences would be if he ate, but he
ate all the same, in a state of mingled pleasure and terror, quite
certain that agony would ensue. Surely, however, Pauline
would never desert him in the midst of one of his attacks.</p>

<p>And indeed it happened that about six o'clock in the
morning Véronique came upstairs to inform Mademoiselle
that she could hear her master bellowing in his bedroom.
The woman was in a very bad temper, and went growling about
the house that if Mademoiselle were going she would certainly
be off as well, as she had grown quite tired of looking after
such an unreasonable old man.</p>

<p>Thus Pauline was once more obliged to take up her
position by her uncle's bedside; and when the Doctor arrived
to take her away with him, she showed him the sick man,
who triumphed, bellowing his loudest, and crying to her to
leave him, if she could find it in her heart to do so. Everything
had to be postponed.</p>

<p>Every day the young girl trembled at the thought of seeing
Lazare and Louise come back. Their new room, the
former guest-chamber, had been specially fitted up, and had been
waiting ready for them ever since their marriage. They were
lingering on at Caen, however, and Lazare wrote to say that he
was making notes on the financial world before returning to
Bonneville and shutting himself up there to start on a great
novel, in which he should reveal the truth about company
promoters and speculators. At last he arrived one morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
without his wife, and unconcernedly announced that he
was going to settle with her in Paris. His father-in-law,
he said, had prevailed upon him to accept that post in
the Insurance Company, on the ground that he would thus
have a good opportunity for making his notes from actual
observation. Later on, he added, he might perhaps, come
back and devote himself to literature.</p>

<p>When Lazare had filled a couple of trunks with the various
articles he required, and Malivoire's coach had come to fetch
him and his luggage, Pauline went back into the house,
feeling quite dazed and destitute of her former energy.
Chanteau, still in great pain, turned to her and exclaimed:</p>

<p>'You will stop now, I hope! Stay and see me buried!'</p>

<p>She was unwilling to make an immediate reply. Her
trunk was still packed in her bedroom. She sat gazing at it
for hours. Since the others were going to Paris, it would be
wrong of her, she thought, to desert her uncle. She had but
little confidence in her cousin's resolutions, but, at any rate,
if he and his wife should come back, she would then be free
to take her departure. And when Cazenove angrily told her
that she was throwing away a splendid position for the sake
of ruining her life amongst people who had lived upon her
ever since her childhood, she virtually made up her mind.</p>

<p>'Be off with you!' Chanteau now repeated. 'If you are
to gain so much money and become so happy that way, I
won't keep you here bothering about an old cripple like me.
Be off with you!'</p>

<p>One morning, however, she replied to him:</p>

<p>'No, uncle, I am going to stay with you.'</p>

<p>The Doctor, who was present, went off, raising his arms to
heaven.</p>

<p>'Ah! there is no doing anything with that child! And
what a hornets' nest she has got into! She will never get
free of it&mdash;never!'</p>

<p>Once more did the days glide by in the house at Bonneville.
After a very cold winter there had come a rainy spring, and
the sea, beaten by the downpour, looked like a huge lake of
mud. Then the tardy summer had lasted into the middle of
autumn, with heavy, oppressive suns, beneath whose overwhelming
heat the blue immensity slumbered. And then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
winter came round again, and another spring, and yet another
summer, slipping away minute by minute, ever at the same
speed, as the hours pursued their rhythmical march.</p>

<p>Pauline, as if her heart were regulated by that clock-like
motion, had recovered all her old calmness. The placid sameness
of her days, which were passed in the same unvarying
occupations, lulled the keenness of her sorrow. She came
downstairs in the morning and kissed her uncle, said much
the same things to the servant as she had said the day before,
sat down twice at table, spent the afternoon in sewing, and
then, early in the evening, went to bed. The next day the
same programme was gone through, without ever any unexpected
incident breaking the monotony of her life. Chanteau,
who was becoming more and more disfigured by gout, which
had puffed out his legs and warped and deformed his hands,
sat silent, when he was not bellowing, quite absorbed in the
delight of being free from pain. Véronique, who seemed
almost to have lost her tongue, had fallen into a state of
gloomy surliness. Only the Saturday dinners brought any
relief. Cazenove and Abbé Horteur dined there with great
regularity, and chatter was heard till ten o'clock or so, when
the priest's wooden shoes clattered away over the stones of
the yard, and the Doctor's gig started off at the slow trot of
the old horse. Pauline's gaiety&mdash;that gaiety which she had
so bravely maintained during all her troubles&mdash;had assumed
a subdued character. Her ringing laughter no longer echoed
through the rooms and the staircase, though she still remained
all kindliness and activity, and every morning displayed fresh
courage and zest for life. By the end of a year her heart
had fallen asleep, and she had come to believe that the days
would now flow on in that peaceful monotony, without anything
ever happening to awake her slumbering sorrow.</p>

<p>For some time after Lazare's departure every letter from
him had troubled the girl, though it was only for his letters that
she lived, looking out for them with impatience, reading them
over and over again, and even adding to them something from
her own imagination beyond what they actually contained.
For three months Lazare had written very regularly, sending,
every fortnight, a very long letter, full of detail and breathing
the liveliest hopes. Once more he was wildly enthusiastic.
He had launched out into business and was dreaming of a
colossal fortune in the immediate future. According to his
account, the Insurance Company could not fail to return<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
enormous profits. He was not, however, confining himself to
that venture, but was engaging in all kinds of speculations.
He appeared to have become quite charmed with the financial
and mercantile world, which he now reproached himself for
having judged so absurdly. All his literary schemes seemed
quite abandoned. Then, too, he was never tired of writing
about his domestic joys, and related all sorts of things about
his wife&mdash;the kisses he had given her, and the life they led
together&mdash;setting forth at length all his happiness by way of
expressing his gratitude to her, whom he called his 'dear
sister.' It was those details, those familiar passages, which
made Pauline's fingers tremble feverishly.&mdash;The odour of love
which the paper diffused, the perfume of heliotrope, Louise's
favourite scent, which clung to it, seemed to stupefy her. But
the letters gradually became fewer and shorter. Lazare
ceased to write about business, and in other respects confined
himself to sending his wife's love to Pauline. He
offered no explanations, but simply ceased to tell her everything.
Was he discontented with his position and already
sick of finance? Was his domestic happiness compromised
by misunderstandings? Pauline was afraid it must be so,
and she was saddened by the evidence of her cousin's weariness,
which she thought she could detect in certain passages
that seemed to have been reluctantly written. About the end
of April, after a six weeks' silence, she received a short note
of four lines, in which her cousin told her that Louise was
<i>enceinte</i>. Then silence fell again, and she had no further
news.</p>

<p>May and June passed away. A heavy tide swept away one
of the stockades, an incident which for a long time afforded
subject for talk. All the Bonneville folk jeered and grinned,
and the fishermen stole the broken timbers. Then came
another scandalous affair. The Gonin girl, young as she
was, had a baby. And afterwards all the old monotony
returned, and the village vegetated at the foot of the
cliffs as lifelessly as a tract of seaweed. In July it became
necessary to repair the terrace-wall and one of the gable ends
of the house. As soon as the workmen began to remove the
first stones, the rest threatened to fall, and they were kept at
work for an entire month, an expense of nearly ten thousand
francs being incurred.</p>

<p>It was still Pauline who had to find the money. Thus
another big hole was made in her little hoard in the chest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
drawers, her little fortune being reduced to about forty
thousand francs. She made the family's few hundred francs
a month go as far as possible by economical housekeeping,
but she was obliged to sell some of her own stock, in order to
avoid encroaching upon her uncle's capital. The latter told
his niece, as his wife had done before, that it would all be paid
back to her some day. The girl would not have hesitated to
part with all she had, for the gradual crumbling away of her
fortune had destroyed all tendency to cupidity in her, and her
only effort now was to keep a sufficient sum in hand for her
charities. The thought that she might possibly be compelled
to discontinue her Saturday distributions greatly distressed
her, for they constituted her chief pleasure of the week. Since
the previous winter she had begun to knit stockings, and all
the young urchins in the neighbourhood now went about with
warm feet.</p>

<p>One morning towards the end of July, as Véronique was
sweeping up the rubbish left by the workmen, Pauline received
a letter which quite upset her. It was written from Caen,
and contained only a few words. In it Lazare informed her
that he should arrive at Bonneville on the evening of the next
day, but gave no explanation of his coming. She ran off to
tell the news to her uncle. They both looked at each other.
Chanteau's eyes expressed the fear that his niece would leave
him should Lazare and his wife contemplate a long stay in
the house. He dare not question her on the subject, for he
could read in her face her firm resolution to go. In the afternoon
she even went upstairs to look over her clothes; still, she
did not wish to have the air of taking flight.</p>

<p>It was about five o'clock, and lovely weather, when Lazare
stepped out of a trap at the door of the yard. Pauline hastened
to meet him, but, before even kissing him, she stopped short
in astonishment.</p>

<p>'What! Have you come alone?'</p>

<p>'Yes,' he replied quietly.</p>

<p>And then he kissed her on both cheeks.</p>

<p>'But where is Louise?'</p>

<p>'At Clermont, with her sister-in-law. The doctor has
recommended her to go to a mountainous neighbourhood.
Her state of health has made her weak and languid.'</p>

<p>As he spoke he walked on to the house, casting long
glances about the yard. He scrutinised his cousin, too, and
his lips quivered with an emotion which he struggled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
restrain. He showed great surprise as a dog rushed out of
the kitchen and barked round his legs.</p>

<p>'What dog is that?' he asked.</p>

<p>'Oh! that's Loulou,' Pauline replied. 'He doesn't know you
yet, you see. Down! Loulou! You mustn't bite your master.'</p>

<p>The dog went on growling.</p>

<p>'He is dreadfully ugly, my dear. Where did you pick up
such a fright?'</p>

<p>The dog was indeed a wretched mongrel, undersized and
mangy. And he had, too, an abominable temper, and was
perpetually snarling, and melancholy like an outcast.</p>

<p>'Oh! when he was given me I was told that he would
grow up into a huge, magnificent animal, but he has always
kept like that. It is the fifth one that we have tried to rear,
All the others have died, and this is the only one that has
managed to go on living.'</p>

<p>Loulou by this time had sulkily made up his mind to lie
down in the sun, and turned his back upon Pauline and her
cousin. Then Lazare thought of the old days and of the dog
that was dead and of the new and ugly one that now occupied
his place. He glanced round the yard once more.</p>

<p>'My poor old Matthew!' he murmured very softly.</p>

<p>On the steps of the house Véronique received him with a
nod of her head, without ceasing to pare carrots. Then he
walked straight on to the dining-room, where his father,
excited by the sound of voices, was anxiously waiting.
Pauline called from the threshold:</p>

<p>'You know he has come by himself? Louise is at
Clermont.'</p>

<p>Chanteau, whose anxious eyes brightened, began to question
his son even before he had kissed him.</p>

<p>'Are you expecting her to follow you? When will she
join you here?'</p>

<p>'Oh no! She's not coming here at all,' Lazare replied.
'I'm going to join her at her sister-in-law's before I return to
Paris. I shall stay a fortnight with you, and then I shall be off.'</p>

<p>Chanteau's eyes expressed his extreme satisfaction at what
he heard, and when at last Lazare embraced him he returned
the salute with two hearty kisses. However, he considered
that it behoved him to express some regret.</p>

<p>'It is a great pity that your wife could not come. We should
have been delighted to have her here. However, I hope we
shall see her some other time. You must certainly bring her.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>Pauline kept silent, and concealed her feeling of uneasiness
beneath an affectionate smile of welcome. For the second
time were her plans being altered; she would not have to go
away. She scarcely knew whether she was glad or sorry, so
entirely had she now become the property of others. Whatever
pleasure she felt in seeing Lazare was tinged with sadness
as she noticed his aged appearance. His eyes were dull, and
a bitter expression rested on his lips. The lines across his
brow and cheeks had been there before, but they were
deeper wrinkles now, and she guessed that his <i>ennui</i> and
terror had increased. The young man scrutinized his cousin
with equal care. She appeared to him to have developed, to
have gained additional beauty and vigour, and with a smile he
muttered:</p>

<p>'Well, you certainly don't seem to have been any the
worse for my absence. You are, all of you, looking quite
plump. Father is growing young again, and Pauline is
superb. And, really, it is very funny, but the house certainly
seems bigger than it used to be.'</p>

<p>He glanced round the dining-room, as he had previously
done round the yard, with an appearance of surprise and
emotion. His eyes at last rested upon Minouche, who lay
upon the table, with her feet tucked under her, in such a
state of restful beatitude that she had not moved.</p>

<p>'Even Minouche doesn't seem to have grown any older,'
the young man resumed. 'Well, you ungrateful animal, you
might rouse yourself to welcome me!'</p>

<p>He stroked her as he spoke, and she began to purr, but
still without moving.</p>

<p>'Oh! Minouche is only interested in herself,' Pauline said
merrily. 'The day before yesterday five more of her kittens
were drowned, and, you see, she doesn't seem to mind it
at all.'</p>

<p>The dinner was hastened, as Lazare had made an early
breakfast. In spite of all the girl's attempts, the evening
proved a gloomy one. The efforts they made to avoid certain
subjects interfered with the conversation, and there were
awkward intervals of silence. Pauline and Chanteau refrained
from questioning Lazare, as they saw that it embarrassed
him to reply; they made no attempt to ascertain
either how his business at Paris was getting on, or how it
came about that his letter to them had been written from
Caen. With a vague gesture he put aside all direct questions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
as though he meant to reply to them later on. When the tea
was brought into the room, a great sigh of satisfaction escaped
him. How happy and peaceful they must all be here, said he,
and what an amount of work one could get through when all
was so quiet! He dropped a word or two about a drama in
verse upon which he had been engaged for the last six
months. His cousin felt amazed when he added that he
intended finishing it at Bonneville. Twelve days would be
sufficient, said he.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Véronique entered to say that Monsieur
Lazare's room was ready. But when they had reached the
first floor, and she wanted to instal him in the former guest-chamber,
which had been subsequently fitted up for the occupation
of himself and his wife, he flew into a tantrum.</p>

<p>'You're quite mistaken,' said he, 'if you suppose that I
am going to sleep there! I'm going up to the top of the
house to my old iron bedstead.'</p>

<p>Véronique began to grumble and growl. Why couldn't
he sleep there? The bed had been got ready for him, and,
surely, he wasn't going to give her the trouble of preparing
another.</p>

<p>'Very well,' he said, 'I will sleep in an easy-chair.'</p>

<p>While Véronique angrily tore off the sheets and carried
them up to the top floor, Pauline experienced a sudden
delight which impelled her to throw her arms round her
cousin's neck, in an outburst of the old chummish feeling of
their youth, as she wished him good-night. He was occupying
his big room once more, and he was so close to her that for
a long time she could hear him pacing about, as though
brooding over the recollections which were keeping her
awake also.</p>

<p>It was only the next morning that Lazare began to take
Pauline into his confidence. Even then he made no clear
statement; she had to guess what she could from a few
short sentences which he let slip in the course of conversation.
By-and-by she took courage and questioned him with
an expression of affectionate concern. Were he and Louise
still getting on as happily as ever? He replied in the
affirmative, but complained about certain little domestic
disagreements and other trifling matters which had led to
quarrels. Without having come to a definite rupture, they
were suffering from the perpetual jarring of two highly-strung
temperaments, which were incapable of equilibrium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
either in joy or sorrow. There existed between them a sort
of unconfessed bitterness, as though they were surprised and
angry at having mistaken each other, at having discovered
each other's real feelings so soon, after all the passionate
love of the first days. For a moment Pauline thought she
could discover that it was pecuniary troubles that had
embittered them; but in this she was mistaken, for their
income of ten thousand francs a year had remained almost
undiminished. Lazare had simply become disgusted with
business, just as he had previously grown disgusted with
music and medicine and industrial enterprise; and on this
subject he launched out in strong language. Never, he said,
never had he come across such a stupid, rotten sphere as
that of the financial world. He would prefer anything, the
dulness of country life and the mediocrity of small means, to
perpetual worries about money, the brain-softening tangle of
figures. He had just retired from the Insurance Company,
he said, and he was going to try what he could do as a play-writer
when he returned to Paris in the following winter.
His drama would avenge him; he would portray money in it
as a festering sore eating away modern society.</p>

<p>Pauline did not distress herself much about this new
failure, which she had already inferred from Lazare's embarrassed
expressions in his last letters. What grieved her most
was the gradually increasing misunderstanding between her
cousin and his wife. She strove to find out the real cause of
it, how it happened that those young people of ample means
and with nothing to do but to be happy had so quickly
reached discomfort. She returned to the subject again, and
only ceased to question her cousin about it when she saw the
embarrassment she was causing him. He stammered and
grew pale, and turned his face away from her as she interrogated
him. She well knew that expression of shame and
fear, that terror of the idea of death, which he had formerly
struggled to conceal as though it were some disgraceful
disease; but could it be possible, she asked herself, that the
cold shadow of nothingness had already fallen between the
young couple so soon after their nuptials? For several days
she lingered in a state of doubt, and then, without any
further confession from him on the subject, she one evening
read the truth in his eyes as he rushed downstairs from his
room in the dark, as though he were pursued by ghosts.</p>

<p>In Paris, amidst his love-fever, Lazare had at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
forgotten all about death. He had found a refuge in
Louise's embraces. But satiety came at last, and then in
that wife of his, for whom life centred in caressing endearments,
he found no sustaining, no courage-prompting influence
whatever. Passion was fugitive and deceitful&mdash;powerless,
he found, to give a semblance of happiness to life. One
night he awoke with a start, chilled by an icy breath that
made his hair stand on end. He shivered and wailed out
his cry of bitter anguish: 'O God! God! oh! to have to
die!' Louise was sleeping by his side. It was death that
he had found again at the end of their kisses.</p>

<p>Other nights followed, and all his old torture came on him
again. It seized him suddenly as he lay sleepless in bed, without
ability on his part to foresee or prevent it. All at once, while
he was lying there perfectly calm, a fearful shudder would convulse
him; whereas, on the other hand, when he was irritable
and weary, he perhaps escaped altogether. It was more than
the mere shock of earlier times that he experienced now; his
nervous excitement increased, and his whole being was
shaken by each fresh attack. He could not sleep without a
night-light, for the darkness increased his anxiety, in spite of
his constant fear that his wife might discover his secret
suffering. This very fear, indeed, increased his distress and
aggravated the effects of his attacks; for in the old days,
when he lay alone, he had been able to vent his dread, but
now the presence of another at his side was a source of
additional disquietude. When he started in terror from his
pillow, his eyes heavy with sleep, he instinctively glanced
at her, fearing he might find her eyes wide open and fixed
upon his own. But she never moved, and by the glimmer
of the night-light he could watch her quiet slumber, her
placid face, thick lips, and little, blue-veined eyelids. And
as she never awoke, he at last grew less disturbed on her
account, until one night what he had so long feared really
happened, and he saw her staring at him. But she said not
a word when she saw him all pale and trembling. She, like
himself, must have been thrilled by the horror of death, for
she seemed to understand what was passing in his mind,
and threw herself against him like a frightened woman
seeking protection. Then, still desiring to deceive each
other, they pretended that they had heard the sound of footsteps,
and got out of bed to look under the furniture and
behind the curtains.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Thenceforward they were both haunted with nervous fear.
Never a word of confession escaped the lips of either. They
felt that it was a shameful secret of which they must not
speak; but as they lay in bed, with their eyes staring widely
into space, they knew quite well what each was thinking
of. Louise had become as nervous as Lazare; they must
have infected each other with this dread, even as two lovers
are sometimes carried off by the same fever. If he awoke,
while she continued to sleep, he grew alarmed at her very
slumber. Was she still breathing? He could not hear the
sound of any respiration. Perhaps she had suddenly died!
He would then peer into her face for a moment and touch
her hands; but, even when he had satisfied himself that she
was alive and well, he could not get to sleep again. The
thought that she would certainly die some day plunged him
into a mournful reverie. Which of them would go first, he
or she? Then his mind dwelt at length on the alternative
suppositions; and scenes of death, with the last torturing
throes, the hideous shrouding and laying-out, the final heart-breaking
separation, presented themselves to his mind. That
thought of never seeing each other again, when they had lived
together thus as man and wife, drove him to distraction, filled
him with revolt; he could not endure the thought of such horror.
His very fear made him wish that he himself might be the first
to go. Then his heart ached with bitter grief for Louise, as
he pictured her as a widow, still carrying on the old routine
of life, doing this and that, when he should no longer be there.
Sometimes, to free himself from those haunting thoughts,
he would gently pass his arms about her without awaking
her; but this he could not long endure, for he became still
more terrified as he felt the pulsations of her life within his
embrace. If he rested his head upon her breast and listened
to her heart, he could not hear it beating without alarm,
without feeling that all action might suddenly cease. And
even love was powerless to drive away that great dread which
still hovered around their curtains after every transport.</p>

<p>About this time Lazare began to grow weary of business.
He fell back into his old state, and spent whole days in idleness,
excusing himself on the ground of the contempt and
dislike he felt for money-grubbing. The real truth was
that constant brooding over the thought of death was daily
depriving him of the desire, the strength to live. He came
back to his old question, 'What was the good of it all?'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
Since it would all end in complete extinction sooner or later,
perhaps to-morrow, or even to-day, or a single hour hence,
what was the use of troubling and exciting one's self and
bothering about one thing more than another? It was all
quite purposeless. His existence itself had become a slow,
lingering death, continuing day after day, and he strained his
ears to listen to the sounds of its progress, even as he had
done before in earlier times, and thought that he could detect
the mechanism of his life quickly running down. His heart,
he fancied, no longer beat so strongly as before, the action
of every other organ was becoming feebler, and all would
doubtless soon come to a dead-stop. He noted with a
shudder that gradual diminution of vitality which growing
age was bringing in its train. His very frame was perishing;
its component parts were constantly disappearing. His hair
was falling off, he had lost several teeth, and he could feel
his muscles and sinews shrinking away, as though they were
already returning to dust. The approach of his fortieth year
filled him with gloomy melancholy; old age would soon be
upon him now and make a speedy end of him. He had
already begun to believe that his system was quite deranged,
and that some vital part would very soon give way. Thus
his days were spent in a morbid expectation of some
catastrophe. He took anxious note of those who died around
him, and every time he heard of the death of an acquaintance
he received a fresh shock. Could it be possible that
such an one was really dead? Why, he was three years
younger than himself and had seemed likely to last a hundred
years! And then that other man he knew so well, had he,
too, really gone? A man who was so careful of himself,
and who even weighed the very food he ate! For a couple
of days after occurrences like these he could think of nothing
else, but remained stupefied by what had happened; feeling
his pulse, carefully observing all his own symptoms, and
then falling foul of the poor fellows who had gone. He felt
a craving to reassure himself, and accused the departed of
having died from their own fault. One had been guilty of
inexcusable imprudence, while another had succumbed to so
rare a disease that the doctors did not even know its name.</p>

<p>But it was in vain that he tried to banish the importunate
spectre; he never ceased to hear within himself the grating
of the wheels which he fancied had so nearly run down;
he felt that he was helplessly descending the slope of years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
and the thought of the deep, black pit that lay at the bottom
of it threw him into an icy perspiration and made his hair
stand on end with horror.</p>

<p>When Lazare ceased going to his office, quarrels broke
out at home. He manifested excessive irritability, which
flared up at the slightest opposition. His increasing mental
disorder, which he tried so carefully to conceal, revealed itself
in angry snappishness, fits of moody sulking, and wild, mad
actions. At one time he was so possessed by the fear of fire
that he removed from a third-floor flat to one on the ground
floor, in order that he might more easily escape whenever
the house should burn. A perpetual anticipation of coming
evil completely poisoned the present, and prevented him from
deriving any enjoyment from it. Every time a door was
opened rather noisily he started up in fear; and his heart
throbbed violently whenever a letter was put into his hand.
He suspected everybody. His money was hidden in small
sums in all sorts of places, and he kept his simplest plans
and intentions secret. He felt embittered, too, against the
world, thinking that he was misunderstood and underrated,
and that all his successive failures were the result of a
general conspiracy against him. But ever-growing boredom
dominated everything else&mdash;the <i>ennui</i> of a man whose mind
was unhinged and to whom the incessant idea of death
made all action distasteful, so that he dragged himself idly
through life on the plea of its nothingness and worthlessness.
What was the use of troubling? The powers of science
were miserably limited; it could neither prevent nor foresee.
He was possessed by the sceptical <i>ennui</i> of his generation,
not the romantic <i>ennui</i> of Werther or René, who regretfully
wept over the old beliefs, but the <i>ennui</i> of the new doubters,
the young scientists who worry themselves and declare that
the world is unendurable because they have not immediately
found the secret of life in their retorts.</p>

<p>In Lazare the unavowed terror of ceasing to be was, by
a logical contradiction, blended with a ceaseless braggart
insistence upon the nothingness of things. It was his very
terror, the want of equilibrium in his morbid temperament,
that drove him into pessimistic ideas and a mad hatred of
life. As it could not last for ever, he looked upon it as
a mere fraud and delusion. Was not the first half of one's
days spent in dreaming of happiness and the latter half in
regrets and fears? He fell back again upon the theories of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
'the old one,' as he called Schopenhauer, whose most violent
passages he used to recite from memory. He expatiated on
the desirability of destroying the wish to live, and so bringing
to an end the barbarous and imbecile exhibition of existence,
with the spectacle of which the master force of the world,
prompted by some incomprehensible egotistical reason,
amused itself. He wanted to do away with life in order to
do away with fear. He always harped upon the great
deliverance; one must wish nothing for fear of evil, avoid
all action since it meant pain, and thus sink entirely into
death. He occupied himself in trying to discover some
practical method of general suicide, some sudden and
complete disappearance to which all living creatures would
consent. This was perpetually recurring to his mind, even in
the midst of ordinary conversation, when he freely and
roughly gave vent to it. The slightest worry was sufficient
to make him cry that he was sorry he was not yet annihilated;
a mere headache set him raging furiously at his body.
If he talked with a friend, his conversation immediately
turned upon the woes of life, and the luck of those who were
already fattening the dandelions in the cemeteries. He had
a perfect mania for mournful subjects, and he was much
interested in an article by a fanciful astronomer who announced
the arrival of a comet with a tail which would
sweep the earth away like a grain of sand. Would not this
indeed prove the expected cosmical catastrophe, the colossal
cartridge destined to blow the world to bits like a rotten old
boat? And this desire of his for death, this constant theorizing
about universal annihilation, was but the expression of his
desperate struggle with his terror, a mere vain hubbub of
words, by which he tried to veil the awful fear which the
expectation of his end caused him.</p>

<p>The knowledge that his wife was <i>enceinte</i> gave him a
fresh shock. It caused him an indefinable sensation, compounded
of joy and an increase of disquietude. Notwithstanding
the contrary views of 'the old one,' the thought of
becoming a father thrilled him with pride&mdash;indeed, a vain
wonder, as though he were the first person whom such a
thing had befallen. But his joy quickly became poisoned; he
tormented himself with forebodings of a disastrous issue;
already making up his mind that his wife would die, and
that the child would never be born. And, indeed, it happened
that Louise's health became very bad, for she was far from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
strong; and then the confusion of the household and the
upsetting of their usual habits, together with their frequent
bickerings, soon made them both thoroughly miserable.
The expectation of a child, which ought to have brought the
husband and wife more closely together, only served, indeed,
to increase the misunderstanding between them. Thus,
when Louise's doctor suggested a visit to the mountains,
Lazare was delighted to take her to her sister-in-law's and
secure a fortnight's freedom for himself on the plea of going
to see his father at Bonneville. At the bottom of his heart
he really felt ashamed of this flight; but, after arguing the
matter with his conscience, he persuaded himself that a
short separation would have a tranquillising effect upon
both of them, and that it would be quite sufficient if he
joined his wife before the expected event.</p>

<p>On the evening when Pauline at last learned the whole
history of the past eighteen months she remained for a
moment unable to speak&mdash;quite overcome, indeed, by the
pitiable story. They were sitting in the dining-room;
she had put Chanteau to bed, and Lazare had just finished
making his confession in front of the cold tea-pot, beneath
the lamp which was now burning dimly.</p>

<p>After an interval of silence Pauline at last exclaimed:</p>

<p>'Why, you don't love each other any longer!'</p>

<p>Her cousin rose to go upstairs, and replied, with an
uneasy smile:</p>

<p>'We love each other as much as is possible, my dear girl.
You don't understand things, shut up here in this hole.
Why should love fare better than anything else?'</p>

<p>As soon as she had closed the door of her own room
Pauline fell into one of those fits of despondency which had
so often tortured her and kept her awake, on the very same
chair, while all the rest of them were sleeping. Was there
going to be a renewal of trouble? She had hoped it was
all done with, both for others and herself, when she had
torn her heart asunder and given Lazare to Louise; and now
she found how useless her sacrifice had been. They had
already ceased to love each other; it was all to no purpose
that she had wept bitter tears and martyred herself. To this
wretched result had she come, to fresh trouble and strife, the
thought of which added to her grief. There seemed to be
no end to suffering!</p>

<p>Then as, with her arms hanging listlessly in front of her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
she sat watching her candle burn away, the oppressive
thought arose from her conscience that she alone was guilty.
She tried, but in vain, to struggle against the facts. It was
she alone who had brought about that marriage, without
understanding that Louise would never prove the wife that
her cousin needed. She saw it now clearly enough. She
recognised that the other was much too nervously inclined
herself to be able to steady him, for she lost her head at
the merest trifle, and her only charm lay in her caressing
nature&mdash;a charm of which Lazare had already tired. Why
did all this only occur to her now? Were not these, indeed,
the very reasons which had determined her to let Louise
take her place? She had thought that Louise possessed
a more loving nature than her own; she had believed that
Louise, with her kisses and caresses, would be able to free
Lazare from his gloomy despondency. Ah! the pity of it
all! To have brought about evil when she had striven
to accomplish good, and to have shown such ignorance of
life as to have brought ruin upon those she yearned to save!
Yet she had felt so sure that she was right and was perfecting
her good work on the day when their happiness had cost her
such bitter tears! Now she felt contempt for her kindliness,
since kindliness did not always create happiness.</p>

<p>The house was wrapped in sleep. In the quiet of her
room she could hear nothing but the throbbing of her
temples. Within her was gradually surging a rebellious
regret. Why had she not married Lazare herself? He had
been hers; she had had no right to give him to another.
Perhaps he might have been wretched and despondent at
first, but by-and-by she would have restored his courage and
protected him from his insane fancies. She had always felt
foolishly doubtful of herself, and from that alone all the
unhappiness had arisen. The consciousness of her own
robust health and strength and all her power of affection
forced itself upon her again. Was she not superior in every way
to that other girl? How foolish she had been in weakly
effacing herself! She loved her cousin sufficiently well to
disappear if the other girl could make him happy; but since
she knew not how to keep his love, was it not her duty to act
and break that wicked union? And her anger grew apace;
she felt that she was both braver and more beautiful than
the other. Conviction flashed upon her mind; it was she
who ought to have married Lazare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>Then she was overwhelmed with regret. The hours of
the night passed, one by one, yet she did not think of seeking
her bed. She sat there, staring at the tall flame of the
candle without seeing it, in a vivid waking dream. She was
no longer in her old bedroom. She thought she had married
Lazare, and their life unrolled itself before her eyes in a series
of pictures of love and delight. They were at Bonneville, by
the edge of the blue sea, or in Paris, in some busy street.
They were in a peaceful little room, with books lying about it
and sweet roses on the table; the lamp gave out a soft, clear
light, while the ceiling was steeped in shadow. Every
moment their hands sought each other. Lazare had recovered
all the careless gaiety of his early youth, and she loved him
so much that he had again come to believe in the eternity of
existence. Just now they were sitting at table; now they were
going out together; to-morrow she would go over the week's
accounts with him. She loved those little domestic details;
she made them the foundation of their happiness, which knew
no break from the laughing toilet in the morning until the
last kiss at night. In the summer they travelled. Then
one day she discovered that she was likely to become a
mother. But just then a shivering shudder dissipated her
dream, and she was no longer far away, but in her own room
at Bonneville, staring at her expiring candle. A mother!
Ah! the misery of it! It was that other who would be one;
never would any of those things happen to herself, never
would those joys be hers! The shock was so painful that
tears gushed from her eyes, and she wept distractedly, sobbing
like one heart-broken. At last the candle burnt out, and
she had to seek her bed in darkness.</p>

<p>That feverish night left Pauline with a feeling of deep
emotion and charitable pity for the disunited husband and
wife, and for herself. Her grief melted into a kind of affectionate
hope. She could not have told on what she was
reckoning; she dared not analyse the confused sentiments
which agitated her heart. But, after all, why should she
trouble herself in this way? Hadn't she at least ten days
before her? It would be time enough to think of matters
by-and-by. What was of immediate importance was to tranquillise
Lazare, so that he might derive some benefit from
his stay at Bonneville. And she assumed her old gaiety of
demeanour, and soon they plunged afresh into their life of
former days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>At first it seemed a renewal of the old comradeship of
early youth. 'Don't bother about that tiresome play of
yours. It will only get hissed. Come and help me to look
whether Minouche has carried my ball of thread on to the
top of the cupboard,' said Pauline.</p>

<p>He held a chair for her, while she mounted upon it, and,
standing on tip-toes, looked for the missing thread. The
rain had been falling for the last two days and they could not
leave the big room. Their laughter rang out as they kept on
unearthing some relic of old days.</p>

<p>'Oh, see! here is the doll which you made out of two of
my old collars. Ah! and this&mdash;don't you remember?&mdash;is
the portrait of you that I drew the day when you made yourself
so frightfully ugly by getting into a rage and crying,
because I wouldn't lend you my razor.'</p>

<p>Then Pauline wagered that she could still jump at a
single bound on to the table; Lazare, too, jumped, quite
glad at being drawn out of himself. His play was already
lying neglected in a drawer. One morning when they came
across the great symphony on Grief she played portions
of it to him, accentuating the rhythm in a comical fashion.
He made fun of his composition and sang the notes to support
the piano, whose weak tones could scarcely be heard. But
one little bit, the famous March of Death, made them both
serious; it was really not bad, and must be preserved.
Everything pleased them and struck a chord of tenderness in
their hearts: a collection of <i>floridæ</i> which Pauline had once
mounted, and which they now discovered behind some books;
a forgotten jar containing a sample of the bromide of potassium
which they had extracted from the seaweed; a small
broken model of a stockade, which looked as though it had
been wrecked by a storm in a tea-cup. Then they romped over
the house, chasing each other like schoolboys at play. They
were perpetually rushing up and down the stairs and scampering
through the rooms, banging the doors noisily. It seemed
as if the old days had come back again. She was ten years
old once more, and he was nineteen; and she again felt for
him all the enthusiastic friendship of a little girl. Nothing
was changed. In the dining-room there still remained the
sideboard of bright walnut, the polished brass hanging-lamp,
the view of Vesuvius, and the four lithographs of the
Seasons, while the grandfather's masterpiece still slumbered
in its old place. There was only one room which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
entered with silent emotion&mdash;that which Madame Chanteau
had occupied, and which had been unused since her death.
The secrétaire was never opened now, but the hangings of
yellow cretonne, with their pattern of flower-work, were fading
from the bright sunlight which was occasionally allowed to
enter the room. It so happened that the anniversary of
Madame Chanteau's birth came round about this time, and
they decked the room with big bunches of flowers.</p>

<p>Soon, however, as the wind rose and dispersed the rain-clouds,
they betook themselves out of doors on to the terrace,
into the kitchen-garden and along the cliffs, and their youth
began anew.</p>

<p>'Shall we go shrimping?' Pauline cried to her cousin one
morning, through the partition, as she sprang out of bed.
'The tide is going down.'</p>

<p>They set off in bathing costumes, and once more found the
old familiar rocks on which the sea had wrought no perceptible
change during the past weeks and months. They could have
fancied that they had been exploring that part of the coast only
the day before.</p>

<p>'Take care!' cried Lazare; 'there is a hole there, you
know, and the bottom of it is full of big stones.'</p>

<p>'Oh, yes, I know; don't be frightened&mdash;&mdash;Oh! do come
and look at this huge crab I have just caught!'</p>

<p>The cool waves splashed round their legs and the fresh
salt breezes from the sea intoxicated them. All their old
rambles were resumed&mdash;the long walks, the pleasant rests on
the sands, the hasty refuge sought in some hollow of the cliffs
at the approach of sudden showers, and the return home
at nightfall along the dusky paths. Nothing seemed changed;
the sea, with its ceaselessly varying aspect, still stretched
out into the boundless distance. Little forgotten incidents
returned to their memory with all the vividness of present
facts. Lazare seemed to be still six-and-twenty and Pauline
sixteen. When he casually happened to pull her about with
his old playful familiarity, she seemed greatly embarrassed,
however, and was thrilled with delicious confusion. But she
in no way tried to avoid him, for she had no thought of the
possibility of evil. Fresh life began to animate them; there
were whispered words, causeless laughter, long intervals of
silence which left them quivering. The most trivial incidents&mdash;a
request for some bread, a remark about the weather,
the good-nights they wished each other as they went to bed&mdash;seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
full of a new and strange meaning. All their past
life was reviving within them and thrilling them with the
tenderness that comes of the remembrance of former happiness.
Why should they have felt anxious? They did not
resist the spell; the sea, with its ceaseless monotonous voice,
seemed to lull and fill them with pleasant languor.</p>

<p>And so the days quietly passed by. The third week of
Lazare's visit was already commencing. He still stayed on,
though he had received several letters from Louise, who felt very
lonely, but whom her sister-in-law wished to keep with her
some time longer. In his replies he had strongly advised her
to stay where she was, even telling her that Doctor Cazenove,
whom he had consulted on the matter, recommended her to
do so. Gradually he fell again into the quiet routine of the
house, accustoming himself once more to the old times for
meals, for getting up and going to bed, which he had changed
in Paris, as well as to Véronique's grumpy humour and the
incessant suffering of his father, who remained immutable,
ever racked by pain, while everything around him altered.
Lazare was confronted, too, by the Saturday dinners, and
the familiar faces of the Doctor and the Abbé, with their
eternal talk of the last gale or the visitors at Arromanches.
Minouche still jumped upon the table at dessert as lightly as a
feather, or rubbed her head caressingly against his chin, and
the gentle scratching of her teeth seemed to carry him back
long years. There was nothing new amongst all those old
familiar things save Loulou, who lay rolled up under the
table, looking mournful and hideous, and growling at everyone
who came near him. It was in vain that Lazare gave
him sugar; when he had swallowed it, the wretched beast
only showed his teeth more surlily than before. They were
obliged to leave him entirely to himself; he led quite a lonely
life in the house, like an unsociable being who only asks of
men and gods to be allowed to spend his time in quiet
boredom.</p>

<p>However, Pauline and Lazare sometimes had adventures
when they were out walking. One day, when they had
quitted the path along the cliffs to avoid passing the works
at Golden Bay, they came across Boutigny at a bend of the
road. He was now a person of some importance, for he had
grown rich by the manufacture of soda. He had married the
woman who had shown herself so devoted as to follow him
into that deserted region, and she had recently given birth to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
her third child. The whole family, attended by a manservant
and a nurse, were driving in a handsome break, drawn
by a pair of big white horses, and the two pedestrians had to
squeeze themselves against the bank to escape being caught
by the wheels. Boutigny, who was driving, checked the
horses into a walking pace. There was a moment's embarrassment.
They had not spoken for years, and the presence
of the woman and the children made the embarrassment still
more painful. At last, as their eyes met, they just bowed to
each other, without a word.</p>

<p>When the carriage had passed on, Lazare, who had
turned pale, said with an effort:</p>

<p>'So he's living like a prince now!'</p>

<p>Pauline, whom the sight of the children had affected,
answered gently:</p>

<p>'Yes; it seems he has made some enormous profits lately.
He has begun to try your old experiments again.'</p>

<p>That, indeed, was the sore point with Lazare. The
Bonneville fishermen, who with their pertinacious banter
seemed bent on making themselves disagreeable to him,
had informed him of what had taken place. Boutigny,
assisted by a young chemist in his employment, was again
applying the freezing treatment to seaweed ashes, and, by
practical and prudent perseverance, had obtained marvellous
results.</p>

<p>'Of course!' Lazare growled, in a low voice; 'every
time that science takes a step forward, it is some fool that
helps her on through sheer accident.'</p>

<p>Their walk was spoilt by that meeting, and they went
on in silence, gazing into the distance and watching the grey
vapour rise from the sea and spread palely over the sky.
When they returned home at nightfall, they were shivering;
however, the cheerful light of the hanging-lamp streaming
down upon the white cloth warmed them again.</p>

<p>Another day, as they were following a path through a field
of beet in the neighbourhood of Verchemont, they stopped in
surprise at seeing some smoke rising from a thatched roof.
The place was on fire, but the brilliance of the sun's rays
streaming from overhead prevented the blaze from being
seen. The house, which had its doors and windows closed,
was apparently deserted, its peasant owners doubtless being
at work in the neighbourhood. Pauline and Lazare at
once left the path, and ran up shouting, but with no other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
effect than that of disturbing some magpies who were chattering
in the apple-trees. At last a woman with a handkerchief
round her head appeared from a distant field of carrots,
glanced about her for a moment, and then rushed on over
the ploughed land as fast as her legs could carry her. She
gesticulated and shouted something which the others could
not catch, for flight interfered with her utterance. After
tripping and falling she got up, then fell again, and started off
once more, with her hands torn and bleeding. Her kerchief
had slipped off her head, and her hair streamed in the
sunlight.</p>

<p>'What was it she said?' asked Pauline, feeling frightened.</p>

<p>The woman was rushing up to them, and at last they
heard her hoarse scream, like the wail of an animal:</p>

<p>'The child! the child! the child!'</p>

<p>Her husband and son had been at work since the morning
some couple of miles away in an oat-field which they had
inherited. She herself had only lately gone out to get a
basketful of carrots, leaving the child asleep, and, contrary
to her habit, fastening up the house. The fire had probably
been smouldering some time, for the woman was stupefied,
and swore she had extinguished every ember before going out.
At all events the thatched roof was now aglow, and flames
shot up athwart the golden sunlight.</p>

<p>'Is the door locked, then?' cried Lazare.</p>

<p>The woman did not hear him. She was quite distraught,
and rushed without any apparent reason round the house,
as though she were trying to discover some opening,
some means of entrance which she must have known did
not exist. Then she fell again. Her legs no longer had
the strength to support her, and her ashy face showed
all the agony of despair and terror, while she continued
screaming:</p>

<p>'The child! the child!'</p>

<p>Big tears rose to Pauline's eyes; but Lazare was even
more painfully affected by the woman's cry, which completely
unnerved him. It was becoming more than he could
bear, and he suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I'll go and fetch your child!'</p>

<p>His cousin looked at him in wild alarm. She grasped his
hands and tried to hold him back.</p>

<p>'You! you mustn't go! The roof will fall in!'</p>

<p>'We'll see about that,' he replied quietly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he shouted in the woman's face:</p>

<p>'Your key! You've got your key with you, haven't you?'</p>

<p>The woman still remained agape, but Lazare hustled her
and at last wrung from her the key. Then, while the
woman remained screaming on the ground, he stepped
quietly towards the house. Pauline followed him with her
eyes, rooted to the ground with fear and astonishment, but
making no further attempt to detain him, for it seemed by
his demeanour as though he were about to attend to some
very ordinary business. A shower of sparks rained on him,
and he had to squeeze himself closely against the door, for
handfuls of burning straw fell from the roof, like water
streaming down during a storm. Moreover, he found himself
hindered by an annoying obstacle. The rusty key would not
turn in the lock. But he manifested no irritation; coolly
taking his time, he at last succeeded in opening the door.
Then he lingered for a moment longer on the threshold, in
order to let out the first rush of smoke, which blew in his
face. Never before had he known such calmness; he
moved as though he were in a dream, with all the assurance,
skilfulness, and prudence which the danger he was encountering
inspired. At last he lowered his head and disappeared
within the cottage.</p>

<p>'O God! O God!' stammered Pauline, who was choking
with anguish.</p>

<p>She clasped her hands involuntarily, almost crushing
them together as she moved them up and down, like one
racked by great agony. The roof was cracking, and was
already collapsing in places. Never would Lazare have time
to make his escape. It seemed an eternity to her since he
had entered. The woman on the ground had ceased crying;
the sight of the gentleman rushing into the fire seemed to
have stupefied her.</p>

<p>But a piercing cry broke through the air. It had come
involuntarily from Pauline, from the very depths of her being,
as she saw the thatch fall in between the smoking walls:</p>

<p>'Lazare!'</p>

<p>He was at the door, his hair scarcely singed and his
hands but slightly scorched; and when he had tossed the
child, who was struggling and crying, into the woman's arms,
he almost became angry with his cousin:</p>

<p>'What's the matter with you? What are you going on
like this for?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<p>She threw her arms round his neck and burst out sobbing
in such a state of nervous excitement that, fearing she
might faint, he made her sit down on an old moss-covered
stone by the side of the house well. He himself was now
beginning to feel faint. There was a trough full of water
there, and he steeped his hands in it with a sensation of
acute relief. The coldness restored him to himself, and he
then began to experience great surprise at what he had done.
Was it possible that he had gone into the midst of those
flames? It was as if he had had a double; he could distinctly
see himself showing incredible agility and presence of
mind amidst the smoke, as though he were looking at some
wonderful feat performed by a stranger. A remnant of
mental exaltation filled him with a subtle joy which he had
never known before.</p>

<p>Pauline had recovered a little, and examined his hands,
saying:</p>

<p>'No! there's no great harm done. The burns are only
slight ones. But we must go home at once, and I will attend
to them. Oh! how you did frighten me!'</p>

<p>She dipped her handkerchief in the water and bound
it round his right hand, which was the more severely burnt
of the two. Then they rose and tried to console the
woman, who, after showering wild kisses on the child, had
laid it down near her, and was now not even looking at it.
She had begun to grieve about the house, wailing pitiably
as she asked what would her men say and do when they
came back and found their home in ruins. The walls were
still standing, and black smoke was pouring out of the brazier
within them, amidst a loud crackling of sparks which could
not be seen.</p>

<p>'Come! my poor woman,' Pauline said to her; 'don't be
so down-hearted. Come and see us to-morrow.'</p>

<p>Some neighbours, attracted by the smoke, now ran up,
and Pauline led Lazare away. Their return home was a
very pleasant one. Though Lazare suffered but little pain,
his cousin insisted upon giving him her arm to support him.
They still felt too much emotion to speak, and they looked at
each other smiling. Pauline felt a kind of happy pride. He
must really be brave, then, in spite of his pallor at the thought
of death! As they made their way along she became absorbed
in astonishment at the inconsistencies of the only man
whom she knew well. She had seen him spend whole nights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
at his work, and then give himself up to idleness for months.
She had known him exhibit the most uncompromising truthfulness
after lying unblushingly. She had received a brotherly
kiss from him on her brow, and she had felt his hands,
hot and feverish with passion, burn her wrists with their
grasp; and now to-day he had proved himself a hero. She
had done right, then, in not despairing of life, in not judging
that everyone must be altogether good or altogether bad.
When they arrived at Bonneville their emotion and silence
found relief in a torrent of rapid talk. They went over every
little detail again, recounting the story a score of times, and
remembering at each repetition some little incident that had
been previously forgotten. The affair was indeed talked
about for a long time afterwards, and help was sent to the
burnt-out peasants.</p>

<p>Lazare had been nearly a month at Bonneville when a
letter arrived from Louise, complaining that she was utterly
overwhelmed with <i>ennui</i>. In his reply to it he told her
that he would fetch her at the beginning of the following
week. There had been some tremendous falls of rain,
those violent deluges which so frequently swept down upon
the district, and shrouded earth, sea, and sky beneath a
pall of grey vapour. Lazare had spoken seriously of finishing
his play, and Pauline, whom he wished to have near him
that she might encourage him, took her knitting&mdash;the little
stockings which she distributed among the village children&mdash;into
her cousin's room. But it was very little work he did
when she had taken her place by the table. They were constantly
talking to each other in low tones, repeating the same
things over and over again, without ever seeming to weary
of them, while their eyes never strayed from one another.
Nothing seemed to them more delightful than that languid
quiet, that feeling of drowsiness which glided over them,
while the rain pattered down upon the slates of the roof. An
interval of silence would at times make them flush, and they
unconsciously put a caress in every word they addressed to
each other, impelled thereto by that influence which had
brought a renewal of those old days which they had thought
had passed away for ever.</p>

<p>One evening Pauline had sat up knitting in Lazare's room
till nearly midnight, while her cousin, whose pen had dropped
idly from his fingers, slowly told her about what he intended to
write in the future&mdash;dramas peopled with colossal characters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
The whole house was asleep. Véronique had gone to bed
long ago, and the deep stillness of the night, through which
only broke the familiar wail of the high tide, gradually permeated
them with tenderness. Lazare, unbosoming himself,
confessed that his life hitherto had been a failure; if literature
also failed him, he had made up his mind to retire to
some secluded spot and live the life of a recluse.</p>

<p>'Do you know,' he added with a smile, 'I often think that
we ought to have emigrated after my mother's death?'</p>

<p>'Emigrated! Why?'</p>

<p>'Yes; have taken ourselves very far away&mdash;to Oceania, for
instance, to one of those islands where life is so sweet and
pleasant.'</p>

<p>'But your father? Should we have taken him with us?'</p>

<p>'Oh! it's only a fancy, a dream, that I'm talking of. One
may indulge in pleasant dreams, you know, when the actual
truth is not very cheerful.'</p>

<p>He had risen from the table and had sat down upon one
of the arms of Pauline's chair. She let her knitting drop,
that she might laugh at ease over the ceaseless flow of the
young man's imagination.</p>

<p>'Are you mad, my poor fellow?' she asked. 'What should
we have done out there?'</p>

<p>'We should have lived! Do you remember that book of
travels that we read together a dozen years ago? There is a
perfect paradise out there. There is no winter, the sky is
always blue, and life is passed beneath the sun and the stars.
We should have had a cabin and have lived upon delicious
fruits, with nothing to do and never a trouble to vex us.'</p>

<p>'Ah! then we should soon have become a pair of
savages, with rings through our noses and feathers on our
heads!'</p>

<p>'Well, why not? We should have loved each other from
one end of the year to the other, taking no count of the days.
Ah! it would have been delightful!'</p>

<p>She looked at him. Her eyelids were quivering and her
face turned pale. That thought of love had filled her with
delicious languor. He had playfully taken hold of her hand
and was smiling in an embarrassed manner. At first
Pauline felt no disquietude. It was nothing more than a
revival of their old intimacy. But she slowly grew disturbed;
her strength seemed to ebb from her, and her very voice
faltered as she said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>'Nothing but fruit would make rather a spare diet. We
should have had to hunt and fish, and cultivate a piece of land.
If it is true, as they say, that the women do the work out
there, would you have set me to dig the ground?'</p>

<p>'You! With those tiny hands of yours! Oh! we could
have made capital servants out of the monkeys, you know!'</p>

<p>She smiled languidly at this pleasantry, while he
added:</p>

<p>'Besides, they would have been no longer in existence,
those little hands of yours! I should have eaten them up&mdash;like this!'</p>

<p>He kissed her hands and pretended to bite at them, while
the blood surged to his face in a sudden thrill of passion.
They neither of them spoke. They were affected by a
common madness&mdash;a vertigo which threw them both into
dizzy faintness. Pauline seemed on the point of swooning;
her eyes closed; but at last, as Lazare's lips suddenly met
hers, the thrill she felt made her raise her eyelids, and she
awoke like one who has just passed through a terrible dream.
Then she sprang to her feet, and, faint though she still felt,
she found courage to resist both Lazare and her own passion.
The struggle was short, but violent. She repulsed him again
and again, and at last, profiting by a brief respite, she fled
across the landing into her own room. He followed, and she
could hear him speaking to her, but in spite of the passionate
promptings of her own heart she kept silent. He sobbed and
her own tears fell, yet she gave him no response. When at
last she heard him close his door behind him she gave full
rein to her grief. It was all over and she had conquered,
but her victory filled her with distress. It was impossible
for her to sleep; she lay awake till morning. What had
happened took complete possession of her thoughts. That
evening had been a sin at which she now shuddered with
horror. She felt that she could no longer find excuse for
herself, that she must acknowledge the duplicity of her
affections. Her motherly love for Lazare and her condemnation
of Louise were but a hypocritical revival of her old
passion for her cousin. She had let herself glide into
falsehood; for, as she analysed more closely the secret
sentiments of her heart, she became conscious that the
rupture between Lazare and his wife had pleased her rather
than otherwise, and that she had hoped in some way to profit
by it. Was it not she, too, who had brought about between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
her cousin and herself a renewal of the intimacy of former
days? Ought she not to have known that the result must
be disastrous? Now matters had reached a terrible pass,
and they were threatened with ruin. She had given him to
another, while she herself loved him passionately, and he,
too, longed for her. This thought careered through her
brain and beat upon her temples like a peal of bells. At
first she made up her mind to run away from the house in
the morning. Then she thought that such flight would be
cowardly. Since Lazare was leaving very shortly, why
should she not remain? Her pride, too, awoke within her;
she resolved to conquer herself, for she felt that she could
never again carry her head erect should the occurrence of
that night inspire her with remorse.</p>

<p>The next morning she came downstairs at her accustomed
hour. There was nothing about her to reveal the night of
torture she had spent except the heaviness of her eyes. She
was pale and quite calm. When Lazare appeared in his
turn, he explained his air of weary lassitude by telling his
father that he had sat up late, working. The day passed in
the usual way. Neither Pauline nor Lazare made any
reference to what had occurred between them, even when
they found themselves alone and free from all observation.
They made no attempt to avoid each other; they appeared
quite confident of themselves. But in the evening, when
they wished each other good-night on the landing near their
rooms, they fell into each other's arms, and their lips met in
a kiss. Then Pauline, full of alarm, hastily escaped and
locked herself in her room, while Lazare, too, rushed away,
bursting into tears.</p>

<p>It was thus that they continued to bear themselves
towards each other. The days slowly glided away, and the
cousins lived on together in constant anxiety of possible
backsliding. Though they never spoke of such a thing, and
never referred to that terrible night, they thought of it
continually and were filled with fear. Their sense of what
was right and honourable remained undimmed, and every
sudden little lapse, any embrace or stolen kiss, left them full
of anger with themselves. But neither had the courage to
take the only safe step, that of immediate separation.
Pauline, believing that it would be cowardly for her to flee,
persisted in remaining in the presence of danger; while
Lazare, absorbed in his transports, did not even reply to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
pressing letters he received from his wife. He had now been
six weeks at Bonneville, and he and Pauline had begun to
believe that this existence of alternate pain and sweetness
would go on for ever.</p>

<p>One Sunday, at dinner, Chanteau became quite gay, after
venturing to drink a glass of Burgundy, a luxury for which
he had to pay very dearly each time that he indulged in it.
Pauline and Lazare had spent some delightful hours together
by the sea under the bright blue sky, exchanging looks full
of tenderness, though marked with that haunting fear of
themselves which infused such passion into their intimacy.</p>

<p>They were all three smiling, when Véronique, who was
just about to bring in the dessert, called from the door of the
kitchen:</p>

<p>'Here comes Madame!'</p>

<p>'Madame who?' cried Pauline, with a feeling of stupefaction.</p>

<p>'Madame Louise!'</p>

<p>They all broke out into exclamations. Chanteau, quite
scared, gazed at Pauline and Lazare, who had turned very
pale. But the latter rose excitedly from his seat and
stammered angrily:</p>

<p>'What! Louise? She never told me she was coming,
and I had forbidden her to do so. She must be mad!'</p>

<p>The twilight was falling, soft and clear. Lazare threw
down his napkin and rushed out of the room. Pauline
followed him, struggling to regain her cheerful serenity. It
was indeed Louise who was alighting with difficulty from
old Malivoire's coach.</p>

<p>'Are you mad?' her husband cried to her across the
yard. 'Why have you done such a foolish thing without
writing to me?'</p>

<p>Then Louise burst into tears. She had been so poorly
at Clermont, she said, and had felt so depressed and weary.
And as her two last letters had remained unanswered, she
had felt an irresistible impulse to set off, a yearning desire to
see Bonneville again. If she had not sent him word of her
intention, it was because she feared that he might have
prevented her from satisfying her whim.</p>

<p>'And to think I was pleased with the idea of taking you
all by surprise!' she concluded.</p>

<p>'It is idiotic! You will go back again to-morrow!' her
husband cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Louise, quite overcome, crushed by this reception, fell into
Pauline's arms. The latter had again turned pale. And
now, when she felt this woman, so soon to be a mother, pressing
against her, both horror and pity came upon her. However,
she succeeded in conquering her jealousy and in silencing
Lazare.</p>

<p>'Why do you speak to her so unkindly? Kiss her! You
did quite right to come, my dear, if you thought you would
be better at Bonneville. You know very well that we all love
you, don't you?'</p>

<p>Loulou was barking furiously at all the hubbub which
disturbed the usual quiet of the yard. Minouche, having
poked her head out of the door, had retired again, shaking
her feet as though she had just escaped mixing herself up
in some compromising incident. The whole party went into
the house, and Véronique laid another cover at the table
and began to serve the dinner over again.</p>

<p>'Hallo! is it really you, Louisette?' Chanteau exclaimed,
with an uneasy smile. 'You wanted to take us by surprise?
You have almost made my wine go the wrong way!'</p>

<p>However, the evening passed off pleasantly. They
had all regained their self-possession, and avoided making
any reference to the immediate future. There was a
momentary revival of embarrassment at bedtime, when
Véronique inquired if Monsieur Lazare was going to sleep in
his wife's room.</p>

<p>'Oh no! Louise will sleep better alone,' Lazare replied,
looking up instinctively and catching Pauline's glance.</p>

<p>'Yes, that will be better,' said the young wife; 'sleep at
the top of the house, for I'm dreadfully tired, and like that I
shall have the whole bed to myself.'</p>

<p>Three days passed. Then Pauline at last came to a
determination. She would leave the house on the following
Monday. Lazare and Louise had already begun to talk of
remaining till after the birth of the expected baby, and
Pauline thought she could see that her cousin had had enough
of Paris, and would settle down altogether at Bonneville,
weary and sick of his perpetual failures. The best thing she
could do, therefore, was to give the place up to them at once,
for she had not been able to conquer herself, and she more
than ever lacked the courage to live beside them and witness
all the intimacy of man and wife. Besides, this course
seemed the best means of escaping from all the perils<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
threatened by the reviving passion from which she and Lazare
had just suffered so cruelly. Louise alone expressed some
astonishment on learning Pauline's decision, but she was
supplied with undeniable reasons for it. Doctor Cazenove
told her that his relation at Saint-Lô had made Pauline
unusually favourable offers, that the girl could not really
refuse them any longer, and that her friends must insist
upon her accepting a position which would make her future
safe. Chanteau, too, with tears in his eyes, expressed his
consent.</p>

<p>On the Saturday came a farewell dinner, with the priest
and the Doctor. Louise, who suffered greatly, could scarcely
drag herself to the table, and this threw additional gloom
over the meal, in spite of the efforts of Pauline, who had
cheerful smiles for everyone, though in reality she grieved
bitterly at the thought of leaving that house, which she had
animated and brightened for so many years with her ringing
laughter. Her heart was aching with pain, and Véronique
served the dinner with a tragic air. Chanteau refused to
touch a single drop of Burgundy, having become all at once
almost superfluously prudent, for he trembled at the thought
of being so soon deprived of a nurse whose mere voice seemed
able to lull his pains. Lazare, for his part, was feverish, and
wrangled with the Doctor about a new scientific discovery.</p>

<p>By eleven o'clock the house had once more subsided into
silence. Louise and Chanteau were already asleep, while
Véronique was tidying up her kitchen. Then, at the top of
the house, by the door of his old room, which he still occupied,
Lazare detained Pauline for a moment, according to his
wont.</p>

<p>'Good-bye!' he murmured.</p>

<p>'No! not good-bye,' she said, forcing herself to smile.
'<i>Au revoir</i>, since I am not going away till Monday.'</p>

<p>They gazed at each other, and as their eyes grew dim
they fell into each other's arms, while their lips met passionately
in a last kiss.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="X" id="X">X</a></h3>


<p>The next morning, as they sat down to their coffee at the
early breakfast, they were surprised that Louise did not make
her appearance. The servant went upstairs to knock at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
door, and when the young woman at last came down it was
evident that she was in a state of great suffering. She
took but a few sips of coffee; and all the morning she dragged
herself about the house, rising from one chair to go and sit
down upon another. They did not venture to speak to her,
for she grew irritable and seemed to suffer the more when
any notice was taken of her. She experienced no relief until
a little before noon, when she was able to sit down at the
table again and take some soup. Between two and three
o'clock, however, she was again unable to remain still, and
dragged herself about between the dining-room and the
kitchen, finally going, with great difficulty, upstairs, but only
to come down again immediately.</p>

<p>At the top of the house Pauline was now packing her
trunk. She was to leave Bonneville the next morning, and
she had only the needful time to empty her drawers and get
everything ready for departure; nevertheless, she every
minute went out on to the landing and looked over the banisters,
distressed by the other's evident suffering. About four
o'clock, as she heard Louise becoming still more agitated,
she resolved to speak to Lazare, who had locked himself up
in his room, full of nervous exasperation at the troubles with
which he accused Fate of overwhelming him.</p>

<p>'We cannot leave Louise like this,' insisted Pauline.
'We must go and talk to her. Come with me.'</p>

<p>They found her half-way on the first flight of stairs,
lacking the strength to go either up or down.</p>

<p>'My dear girl,' said Pauline tenderly, 'we are quite
distressed about you. We are going to send for Madame
Bouland.'</p>

<p>At this Louise grew angry. 'Why do you torment me
like this,' she cried, 'when all that I want is to be left
alone? I shan't need Madame Bouland for a long time yet.
Leave me alone and don't torture me!'</p>

<p>Louise showed herself so obstinate and displayed so much
temper that Lazare, in his turn, grew angry; however,
Pauline was compelled to promise that she would not send
for Madame Bouland. This person was an <i>accoucheuse</i> of
Verchemont, who possessed an extraordinary reputation
throughout the district for skill and energy. She was considered
to have no equal at Bayeux or even at Caen. It was
on account of this great reputation of hers that Louise, who
was very timid and had a presentiment of disaster, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span>
resolved to place herself in her hands. None the less she
experienced a great fear of Madame Bouland&mdash;the same
irrational fear, indeed, with which patients contemplate a
dentist whom it is necessary they should visit, though they
defer doing so as long as possible.</p>

<p>At six o'clock Louise felt much better again, and showed
herself very triumphant in consequence. But she was worn
out, and, when she had eaten a cutlet, she went back to her
room. She would be all right, she said, if she could only
get to sleep. Thus she obstinately refused to let anyone sit
upstairs with her, and insisted upon being left alone. The
others then sat down to a stew and a piece of roast veal.
The dinner began in silence, for Louise's illness increased
the gloom which was caused by Pauline's approaching departure.
They made as little noise as possible with their spoons
and forks, for fear it might reach the ears of the invalid and
still further distress her. Chanteau, however, grew very
loquacious by degrees, and had begun relating some wonderful
stories, when Véronique, as she was handing round the
veal, suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>'I'm not quite sure, but I fancy I can hear Madame
Lazare groaning upstairs.'</p>

<p>Lazare sprang from his seat and opened the door. They
all gave over eating, and strained their ears to listen. At
first they could hear nothing, but soon the sound of prolonged
groaning reached them.</p>

<p>Pauline thereupon threw down her napkin and ran upstairs,
followed by Lazare. And now Louise, whom they
found seated on her bed in a dressing-gown, rather peevishly
consented to let them send for Madame Bouland. When
Lazare, however, suggested that they had better send for
Doctor Cazenove as well, on the chance of complications
arising, his wife burst into tears. Hadn't they the least pity
for her, she cried? Why did they go on torturing her?
They knew very well that the idea of being attended by a
doctor was intolerable to her. She would have nobody but
Madame Bouland.</p>

<p>'If you send for the Doctor,' said she, 'I'll get into bed
and turn my face to the wall and refuse to say another word
to anybody.'</p>

<p>'At any rate, go for Madame Bouland,' said Pauline to
Lazare by way of conclusion. 'She may be able to give her
some relief.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>

<p>They both went downstairs again, and found Abbé
Horteur, who had come to pay a short visit, standing in
silence before the alarmed Chanteau. An attempt was made
to persuade Lazare to eat a little veal before starting, but he
declared that a single mouthful would choke him, and forthwith
he set off at a run to Verchemont.</p>

<p>'I think I hear her calling me!' Pauline exclaimed a
moment later, hastening towards the staircase. 'If I want
Véronique I will knock on the floor. You can finish your
dinner without me, can't you, uncle?'</p>

<p>The priest, much embarrassed at finding himself in the
midst of this confusion, could not summon up his customary
consolatory phrases, and he also soon retired, promising,
however, to return after he had been to the Gonins', where
the crippled old man was very ill. Thus Chanteau was left
alone before the disordered table. The glasses were half full,
the veal was growing cold on the plates, and the greasy forks
and half-eaten pieces of bread still lay where they had been
dropped in the sudden alarm which had come upon the
diners. As Véronique put a kettle of water on the fire, by
way of precaution, in case it might be wanted, she began to
grumble at not knowing whether she ought to clear the table
or leave things in their present state of confusion.</p>

<p>Two anxious hours went by; nine o'clock came, and still
Madame Bouland did not arrive. Louise was now anxiously
longing for her to come, and bitterly complained that they
must want her to die, since they left her so long without
assistance. It only took twenty-five minutes to get to
Verchemont, and an hour ought to have been sufficient to
fetch the woman. Lazare must be amusing himself somewhere,
or, perhaps, an accident had happened, and no
one would ever come at all. Then, however, the young
wife ceased complaining, for an attack of sickness came
upon her, and the whole house was once more in a state of
alarm.</p>

<p>Eleven o'clock struck, and the delay became intolerable.
So Véronique in her turn set off for Verchemont. She took a
lantern with her, and was instructed to search all the ditches.
Meantime Pauline remained with Louise, unable to assist her
in spite of her desire to do so.</p>

<p>It was nearly midnight when the sound of wheels at last
impelled the girl to rush downstairs.</p>

<p>'Why, where is Véronique?' she cried out from the steps,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
as she recognised Lazare and Madame Bouland. 'Haven't
you met her?'</p>

<p>Lazare replied that they had come by the Port-en-Bessin
road, after encountering all sorts of hindrances. On reaching
Verchemont he had found that Madame Bouland was
eight miles away attending to another woman. He could
procure no horse or vehicle to go after her, and had been
obliged to make the whole journey on foot, running all the
way. And, besides, there had been endless other troubles.
Fortunately, however, Madame Bouland had a trap with her.</p>

<p>'But the woman!' exclaimed Pauline. 'She has been
attended to all right, I suppose, since Madame Bouland has
been able to come with you?'</p>

<p>Lazare's voice trembled as he replied hoarsely:</p>

<p>'The woman is dead.'</p>

<p>They went into the hall, which was dimly lighted by a
candle placed on the stairs. There was an interval of silence
while Madame Bouland hung up her cloak. She was a short,
dark woman, very thin, and as yellow as a lemon, with a
large prominent nose. She spoke loudly, and had an
extremely authoritative manner, which caused her to be
much respected by the peasantry.</p>

<p>'Will you be good enough to follow me?' Pauline said to
her. 'I have been quite at a loss to know what to do; she
has never ceased complaining since the beginning of the
evening.'</p>

<p>Louise still stood before a chest of drawers in her room,
pawing the floor with her feet. She burst into tears as soon
as she saw Madame Bouland, who forthwith began to question
her. But the young wife turned a glance of entreaty
towards Pauline, which the latter well understood. She
therefore led Lazare from the room, and they both remained
on the landing, unable to take themselves further away. The
candle, which was still burning below, threw a dim light,
broken by weird shadows, up the stairs, and the two cousins
stood, Lazare leaning against the wall and Pauline against
the banisters, gazing at each other in motionless silence.
They strained their ears to catch the sounds that came from
Louise's room; and when Madame Bouland at last opened
the door they would have entered, but she pushed them
back, came out, and closed the door behind her.</p>

<p>'Well?' Pauline murmured.</p>

<p>She signed to them to go downstairs, and it was not till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
they had reached the ground floor that she opened her mouth.
It was a premature and very difficult case.</p>

<p>'It seems likely to be extremely serious,' she said. 'It is
my duty to warn the family.'</p>

<p>Lazare turned pale. An icy breath passed over his brow.
Then in stammering accents he asked for particulars.</p>

<p>Madame Bouland gave them, adding: 'I cannot undertake
the responsibility. The presence of a doctor is absolutely
necessary.'</p>

<p>Silence fell once more. Lazare was overcome with
despair. Where were they to find a doctor at that time of
night? His wife might die twenty times before they could
get the surgeon from Arromanches.</p>

<p>'I don't think there is any immediate danger,' said
Madame Bouland; 'still, you had better lose no time. I
myself can do nothing further.'</p>

<p>And as Pauline besought her, in the name of humanity,
to try something, at any rate, to alleviate the sufferings of
Louise, whose groans echoed through the house, she replied
in her clear sharp voice: 'No, indeed; I can do nothing of
that kind. That other poor woman over yonder is dead, and
I would rather not be responsible for this one.'</p>

<p>Again did Lazare shudder. At this moment, however,
a tearful call was heard from Chanteau in the dining-room.</p>

<p>'Are you there? Come in! No one has been to tell me
anything. I have been waiting to hear something ever so
long.'</p>

<p>They entered the room. They had forgotten all about
poor Chanteau since the interrupted dinner. He had
remained at the table, twisting his thumbs and patiently
waiting with all the drowsy resignation which he had
acquired during his long periods of lonely quiescence. This
new catastrophe, which was revolutionising the house, had
greatly saddened him; he had not even had heart enough
to go on eating, his food still remained untouched on his
plate.</p>

<p>'Is she no better?' he inquired.</p>

<p>Lazare ragefully shrugged his shoulders. But Madame
Bouland, who retained all her accustomed calmness, pressed
the young man to lose no further time.</p>

<p>'Take my trap!' she said. 'The horse is tired out; still,
you will be able to get back in two hours or two hours and a
half. I will stay here and look after her.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>Then with sudden determination Lazare rushed out of
the room, feeling convinced that he would find his wife dead
upon his return. They could hear him shouting and lashing
the horse with his whip as the conveyance clattered noisily
away.</p>

<p>Madame Bouland went upstairs again, and Pauline
followed her, after briefly replying to her uncle's questions.
When she had offered to put him to bed he had refused to
go, insisting on staying up in order that he might know how
things went on. If he felt drowsy, he said, he could sleep
very well in his easy-chair, for he often slept in it the whole
afternoon. He had only just been left alone again when
Véronique returned with her lantern extinguished. She was
boiling over with rage. For two years she had never poured
forth so many words at one time.</p>

<p>'Of course they took the other road!' she cried. 'And
there have I been looking into all the ditches and nearly killing
myself to get to Verchemont! And I waited, too, for a
whole half-hour down there in the middle of the road!'</p>

<p>Chanteau looked at her with his big eyes.</p>

<p>'Well, my girl, it was scarcely likely that you would meet
each other.'</p>

<p>'And then, as I was coming back,' she continued, 'I met
Monsieur Lazare galloping on like a madman in a crazy gig.
I shouted out to him that they were anxiously waiting for
him, but he only whipped his horse the more violently and
nearly ran over me. I've had quite enough of these errands, of
which I can make neither head nor tale. To make matters
worse, too, my lantern went out.'</p>

<p>She hustled her master about, and tried to make him finish
eating his food, so that she might, at any rate, get the table
cleared. He was not at all hungry, but he ate a little of the
cold veal for the sake of doing something. He was worried
now by the Abbé's failure to return that evening. What was
the use of the priest promising to come and keep him company
if he had made up his mind to stay at home? However,
priests certainly cut a comical figure on such occasions as the
present; and, this idea, amusing Chanteau, he set himself
cheerfully to take his supper in solitude.</p>

<p>'Come, sir, make haste!' cried Véronique. 'It is nearly
one o'clock, and it won't do to have the plates and dishes and
things lying about like this till to-morrow. There's always
something going wrong in this awful house!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>She was just beginning to clear the table when Pauline
called to her from the staircase. Then Chanteau was once
more left alone and forgotten in front of the table, and nobody
came again to give him any news.</p>

<p>Louise was in quite a desperate condition, and her
strength seemed to be rapidly ebbing away, when, about half-past
three o'clock, Véronique privately warned Pauline of
Lazare's arrival with Doctor Cazenove. Madame Bouland
insisted on remaining alone with the Doctor beside the patient,
while the others betook themselves to the dining-room, where
Chanteau was now fast asleep. And then there again came
a long, weary, and very anxious wait. When the Doctor
joined them his voice betrayed his emotion.</p>

<p>'I have done nothing yet,' said he; 'I wouldn't do anything
without consulting you.'</p>

<p>And thereupon he passed his hand over his forehead, as if
to drive away some irksome thought.</p>

<p>'But it is not for us to decide, Doctor,' said Pauline, for
Lazare was incapable of speech; 'we leave her in your
hands.'</p>

<p>He shook his head. 'I must tell you,' said he, 'that both
mother and child seem to me lost. Perhaps I might save
one or the other.'</p>

<p>Lazare and Pauline rose up shuddering. Chanteau,
aroused by the conversation, opened his heavy eyes and
listened with an expression of amazement.</p>

<p>'Which of the two must I try to save?' repeated the
Doctor, who trembled as much as those of whom he asked the
question&mdash;'the child or the mother?'</p>

<p>'Which, O God?' cried Lazare. 'Do I know? Can I
say?'</p>

<p>Tears choked him once again, whilst his cousin, ghastly
pale, remained silent in presence of that awful alternative.</p>

<p>But Cazenove went on giving explanations. 'It is a
case of conscience,' he concluded. 'I beg of you, decide
yourselves.'</p>

<p>Sobs now prevented Lazare from answering. He had
taken his handkerchief and was twisting it convulsively
whilst striving to recover a little of his reason. Chanteau
still looked on in stupefaction. And only Pauline was able
to say, 'Why did you come down? It is cruel to torture
us like this, when you alone know the best course, and alone
are able to act.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then Madame Bouland herself descended the stairs
to say that matters were becoming much worse. 'Have you
decided?' she inquired. 'The lady is sinking.'</p>

<p>Thereupon, with one of those sudden impulses which
disconcerted people, Cazenove threw his arms about Lazare,
kissed him, and exclaimed: 'Listen, I will try to save them
both.... And if they succumb&mdash;well, I shall be yet more
grieved than yourself, for I shall take it to be my own fault.'</p>

<p>Excepting Chanteau, who in his turn embraced his son,
they all went upstairs together. Cazenove desired it. Louise
was fully conscious, but very low. She offered no objection
to a doctor now; her sufferings were too great. When he
began to speak to her she simply answered: 'Kill me; kill me
at once.'</p>

<p>There came a cruel and affecting scene. It was one of
those dread hours when life and death wrestle together, when
human science and skill battle to overcome and correct the
errors of Nature. More than once did the Doctor pause,
fearing a fatal issue. The patient's agony was terrible, but
at last science triumphed, and a child was born. It was a
boy.</p>

<p>Lazare, who had turned his face to the wall, was sobbing,
and burst out into tears. He had been a prey to the keenest
mental torture during the progress of the operations, and he
thought despairingly that it would be preferable for them all
to die rather than to continue living if such intense agony
was to be mingled with life.</p>

<p>But Pauline bent over Louise and kissed her on the forehead.</p>

<p>'Come and kiss her!' she said to her cousin.</p>

<p>He came and stooped down over his wife; but he shuddered
when his lips touched her brow, which was moist with
icy perspiration. Louise lay there with her eyes closed,
and seemed to be no longer breathing. Lazare leaned against
the wall at the foot of the bed, trying to stifle his sobs.</p>

<p>'I am afraid the child is dead,' said the Doctor.</p>

<p>The baby, indeed, had given utterance to none of the usual
shrill calls. It was a very small infant of a deathly hue.</p>

<p>'We might try the effect of friction and inflation,' the
Doctor continued; 'but I'm afraid it would only be time
wasted. And the mother stands in need of all my attention.'</p>

<p>Pauline heard him.</p>

<p>'Give me the child!' she exclaimed. 'I will try what I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
can do. If I don't manage to make it breathe, it will be that
I have no more breath left myself.' Thereupon she carried
the infant into the next room, the room which had once been
Madame Chanteau's, taking with her a bottle of brandy and
some flannel. She laid the poor wee creature in an arm-chair
before a blazing fire; and then, having steeped a piece of
flannel in a saucer of brandy, she knelt down and rubbed it
without a pause, quite regardless of the cramp that gradually
stiffened her arm. It was so small a child, and looked so
wretched and fragile, that she feared lest she might kill it by
rubbing it too hard. And so she passed the flannel backwards
and forwards with a gentle, almost caressing motion,
like the constant brushing of a bird's wing. Then she turned
the child over, and tried to recall each of its tiny limbs to life.
But it still lay there motionless. Though the friction seemed
to impart a little warmth, the infant's chest remained
shrunken, uninflated, and it even seemed to grow darker in
colour.</p>

<p>Then, without evincing any repugnance, Pauline pressed
her mouth to its tiny, rigid lips, and drawing long, slow
breaths she strove to adapt the force of her lungs to the
capacity of those little compressed organs into which the air
had been unable to make its way. She was obliged to stop
every now and then, when her breath grew exhausted; but,
after inhaling a fresh supply, she turned to her task again.
Her blood mounted to her head, and her ears began to buzz;
she even became a little giddy. Nevertheless she still persevered,
striving to inflate the baby's lungs for more than half
an hour, without being encouraged by the least result. She
vainly tried to make the ribs play by pressing them very
gently with her fingers. But nothing seemed to do the least
good, and anyone else would have abandoned in despair this
apparently impossible resurrection. Pauline, however, brought
maternal perseverance to her task, the obstinate insistence of
a mother who is determined that her child shall live, and at
last she felt that the poor wee body was stirring, that its tiny
lips moved slightly beneath her own.</p>

<p>For nearly an hour she had remained alone in that
room, absorbed in the anguish of that struggle with death,
and forgetful of all else. That faint sign of life, that
transitory tremor of the little lips, filled her with fresh
courage. She had recourse to friction again, and every other
minute she resumed her attempt at inflation, employing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>
two processes alternately without any regard for her own
exhaustion. She felt a growing craving to conquer and produce
life. For a moment she feared she had been mistaken,
for it again seemed that her lips were only pressing lifeless
ones. But she became conscious of another rapid contraction.
Little by little the air was forcing its way into the
child's lungs; she could feel it being sucked from her and
returned, and she even fancied she could detect the little
heart beginning to beat. Her mouth never left the tiny
lips; she shared her life with that little creature; they had
only one breath between them in that wonderful resurrection,
a slow, continuous exchange of breath going from one to the
other as if they had a common soul. Pauline's lips were
soiled, for the child had scarcely been cleansed, but her
joy at having saved it prevented any feeling of disgust. She
began to inhale a warm pungency of life, which intoxicated
her; and when, at last, the baby broke out into a
feeble, plaintive wail, she fell back from the chair on to the
floor, stirred to the depths of her being.</p>

<p>The big fire was blazing brightly, filling the room with
cheerful light. Pauline remained on the floor in front of the
baby, whom she had not yet examined. What a poor, frail
mite it was! All her own robust vigour rose up in rebellious
protest as she thought what a wretched puny son Louise had
given to Lazare. She felt keen regret for her own wasted
life. She herself would never be a mother! She was young
and strong, and healthy and beautiful, but of what avail was
all that? The fulness of life was not for her. And she wept
for the child that she would never have.</p>

<p>Meantime the poor, frail little creature that she had
revived to existence was still wailing and writhing on the
chair, and Pauline began to fear that it might fall upon the
floor. Her pity was aroused at the sight of such uncomeliness
and weakness. She would at least do what she could for
it; she would help it to continue living, as she had had the
happiness of helping it into life. So she took it upon her
knees and did what she could for it, while still shedding
tears, in which were mingled sorrow for her own lonesome
fate and pity for the misery of all living creatures.</p>

<p>Madame Bouland, whom she called, came to help her to
wash the baby. They wrapped it in warm flannels and
then laid it in the bed, till the cradle should be prepared for
it. Madame Bouland was astonished to find it alive, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
examined it carefully. It seemed well formed, she said,
but its frailty would make it difficult to rear. Then she
hurried off again to Louise, who still remained in a very critical
condition.</p>

<p>As Pauline was again taking up her position at the baby's
side Lazare, who had been informed of the miracle his
cousin had accomplished, entered the room.</p>

<p>'Come and look at him!' said Pauline, with much
emotion. But as he drew near he began to tremble, and
exclaimed:</p>

<p>'What! you have laid him in that bed!'</p>

<p>He had shuddered as he entered. That room, so long
unused, so full of mournful associations and so rarely entered,
was now warm and bright, enlivened by the crackling of the
fire. Each article of furniture was still in its accustomed
position, and the clock still marked twenty-three minutes to
eight. No one had occupied that chamber, now prepared for
Madame Bouland, since his mother had died there. And it
was in that very bed where she had passed away&mdash;in that
sacred, awful bed&mdash;that he saw his own son restored to life,
looking so tiny as he lay among the spreading coverings.</p>

<p>'Does it displease you?' Pauline asked in surprise.</p>

<p>He shook his head. He could not speak for emotion. At
last he stammered:</p>

<p>'I was thinking of mamma. She has gone, and now here
is another who will go away as she went. Why, then, did
he come?'</p>

<p>His words were cut short by a burst of sobbing. His
terror and his disgust of life broke out in spite of all the
efforts he had made to restrain himself since Louise's
terrible delivery. When he had touched his baby's brow
with his lips, he hastily stepped back, for he had fancied
that he could feel the infant's skull giving way beneath his
touch. He was filled with remorseful despondency at the
sight of the poor, frail little thing.</p>

<p>'Don't distress yourself!' said Pauline, by way of
cheering him. 'We'll make a fine young fellow of him.
It doesn't at all matter that he is small now.'</p>

<p>He looked at her, and, utterly upset as he was, a full
confession escaped from his heart:</p>

<p>'It is again to you that we owe his life! Am I destined,
then, to be always under obligations to you?'</p>

<p>'To me!' she exclaimed. 'I have done nothing more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
than Madame Bouland would have done if I hadn't happened
to be here.'</p>

<p>He silenced her with a wave of his hand.</p>

<p>'Do you think,' he said, 'that I am so base that I cannot
understand that I owe everything to you? Ever since you
first came into this house you have never ceased to
sacrifice yourself. I will say nothing now about your
money, but you still loved me yourself when you gave me
to Louise. I know it now quite well. Ah! if you only
knew the shame I feel when I look at you and recollect!
You would have given your very life-blood, you were always
kind and cheerful, even at the very time when I was
crushing down your heart. Ah, yes! you were right;
cheerfulness and kindliness are everything; all else is mere
delusion!'</p>

<p>She tried to interrupt him, but he continued in a
louder voice:</p>

<p>'What a fool I made of myself with all my disbelief
and boasting, and all the pessimism which I paraded out
of vanity and fear! It was I who spoilt our lives&mdash;yours
and my own, and those of the whole family. Yes! you were
the only sensible one amongst us! Life becomes so easy when
everyone in a family is cheerful and affectionate, and each
lives for the others. If the world is to die of misery, at any
rate let it die cheerfully, and in sympathy with itself!'</p>

<p>Pauline smiled at the violence of his language, and
caught hold of his hands.</p>

<p>'Come! come!' she said, 'don't excite yourself! Now
that you see I was right, you are cured, and all will go
well.'</p>

<p>'Ah! I don't know that! I am talking like this just now,
because there are times when the truth will force itself out,
even in spite of one's self. But to-morrow I shall slip back
into all my old torment. One can't change one's nature!
No, no! Things will go no better. On the contrary, they
will gradually get worse and worse. You know that as well
as I do. It is my own stupidity that enrages me.'</p>

<p>She drew him gently towards her, and said to him in
her grave way:</p>

<p>'You are neither foolish nor base; you are unfortunate.
Kiss me, Lazare.'</p>

<p>They exchanged a kiss before that poor little babe, who
seemed to be asleep. It was the kiss of brother and sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
untainted by the slightest breath of the passion which had
glowed within them only the day before.</p>

<p>The dawn was breaking, a soft grey dawn. Cazenove
came to look at the baby, and was astonished to find it doing
so well. He determined to take it back into the other room,
for he felt that he could now answer for Louise. When the
little creature was brought to its mother, she looked at it
with a feeble smile, then closed her eyes and fell into deep
and restorative slumber. The window had been slightly
opened, and a delicious freshness, like a very breath of life,
streamed in from the sea. They all stood for a moment
motionless, worn out, but very happy, beside the bed in
which the young mother was sleeping. Then, with silent
tread, they left the room, leaving Madame Bouland to watch
over her.</p>

<p>The Doctor, however, did not go away till nearly eight
o'clock. He was very hungry, and Lazare and Pauline themselves
were famished, so Véronique prepared some coffee and
an omelet. Downstairs they found Chanteau, whom they
had all forgotten, sleeping soundly in his chair. Nothing had
been touched since the previous evening, and the room reeked
with the acrid smoke of the lamp, which was still burning.
Pauline jokingly remarked that the table, on which the
plates and dishes had remained, was already laid for them.
She swept up the crumbs and made the things a little tidier.
Then, as the coffee took some little time to prepare, they
attacked the cold veal, joking the while about the dinner that
had been so unpleasantly interrupted. Now that all danger
was over, they were as merry as children.</p>

<p>'You will hardly believe it,' Chanteau exclaimed, beaming,
'but I slept without being asleep. I was very angry that
nobody came down to give me any news, but I felt no uneasiness,
for I dreamt that all was going on well.'</p>

<p>His delight increased when he saw Abbé Horteur enter
the room. The priest had come across after saying Mass.
Chanteau joked him merrily.</p>

<p>'Ah! here you are at last! You deserted me in a nice
way last night! Are you frightened of babies, then?'</p>

<p>The priest defended himself from this charge by telling
them how he had one night delivered a poor woman on the
high-road and baptized her child. Then he accepted a small
glass of curaçoa.</p>

<p>Bright sunshine was gilding the yard when Dr. Cazenove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>
at last took his departure. As Lazare and Pauline walked
with him to the gate, he whispered to the latter:</p>

<p>'You are not going away to-day?'</p>

<p>She remained for a moment silent, then raised her big
dreamy eyes, and seemed to be looking far away into the
future.</p>

<p>'No!' she answered; 'I must wait.'</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h3><a name="XI" id="XI">XI</a></h3>


<p>After an abominable month of May, June set in with very
warm weather. Westerly gales had been blowing for the last
three weeks, storms had devastated the coast, swept away
masses of the cliffs, swallowed up boats, and killed many
people; but now the broad blue sky, the satiny sea, and the
bright hot days were infinitely pleasant and enjoyable.</p>

<p>One glorious afternoon Pauline had wheeled Chanteau's
chair on to the terrace, and near him, on a red woollen rug,
she had deposited little Paul, who was now eighteen months
old. She was his godmother, and she spoilt the child as much
as she did the grandfather.</p>

<p>'Are you sure the sun won't inconvenience you, uncle?'
she asked.</p>

<p>'Oh dear no! I should think not, indeed! It is so long
since I saw it. Are you going to leave little Paul asleep
there?'</p>

<p>'Yes. The fresh air will do him good.'</p>

<p>She knelt down on the edge of the rug and gazed at him.
He was dressed in a white frock, with bare legs and arms
peeping beyond it. His eyes were fast closed, and his quiet
little rosy face was turned up towards the sky.</p>

<p>'He has dropped off to sleep at once,' she said softly. 'He
tired himself out with rolling about. Don't let the animals
bother him.'</p>

<p>She shook her finger at Minouche, who sat at the dining-room
window making an elaborate toilet. Some distance off
Loulou lay stretched out on the gravel, opening his eyes
every now and then with a glance of suspicion, and ever
ready to snarl and bite.</p>

<p>As Pauline rose to her feet again, a low groan came from
Chanteau.</p>

<p>'Ah! has your pain returned?'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span></p>

<p>'Returned! Ah! it never leaves me now. I groaned,
eh? Well, it's funny, but I do so without even being aware
of it.'</p>

<p>He had become a most pitiable object. By degrees his
chronic gout had led to the accumulation of cretaceous
matter at all his joints, and great chalk-stones had formed
and pushed out through his skin. His feet, which were
hidden out of sight in his slippers, were contracted inwards
like the claws of a sickly bird. But his hands openly displayed
all their horrible deformity, swollen as they were at
every joint with gleaming red knots, the fingers warped by
swellings which forced them apart, and the left hand being
rendered especially hideous by a secretion as big as a small egg.
On the left elbow, too, a more voluminous deposit had brought
on an ulcer. Ankylosis was now complete; Chanteau could
no longer make use of his hands or feet, and the few joints
which could still slightly bend cracked with as much noise as
though a bag of marbles were being shaken. His whole body
seemed to have become petrified in the position which he had
adopted as the least painful&mdash;that is, a somewhat forward one,
with an inclination to the right; and he had so completely
shaped himself to his easy-chair that even when he was put
to bed he remained twisted and bent. His pain never left
him now, and the least change in the weather, or a drop of
wine, or a mouthful of meat in excess of his usual diet,
brought on inflammation.</p>

<p>'Would you like a glass of milk?' Pauline asked him.
'It would refresh you perhaps.'</p>

<p>'Ah! milk indeed!' he replied, between two groans.
'That's another pretty invention of theirs, that milk-cure!
I believe they finished me off with that! No, no! I won't
take anything; that's the treatment that does me the most
good.'</p>

<p>He asked her, however, to change the position of his left
leg, for he could not move it himself.</p>

<p>'The villain is all on fire to-day. Put it further away;
push it. There, that will do, thank you. What a lovely day!
Oh dear! oh dear!'</p>

<p>With his eyes turned towards the far-spreading panorama,
he continued to groan quite unconsciously. His moan of
pain had now become quite as natural to him as breathing
itself. He was wrapped in a heavy blue woollen rug, and his
poor deformed hands, that looked so pitiable in the bright<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
sunshine, lay helpless on his knees. It pleased him to sit
and look at the sea with its infinite azure, over which white
sails flitted as over a boundless highway, open there before
him who could no longer put one foot before another.</p>

<p>Pauline, feeling anxious at the sight of Paul's little naked
legs, knelt down again and covered them up with part of the
rug. For three months past she had always been intending
to take her departure on the following Monday. But the
child's feeble hands held her back with a force she could not
resist. For the first month of the boy's life they had each
morning feared that he would not live to see the evening.
It was Pauline who had kept him alive from day to day, for
his mother was long confined to her bed, and the nurse, whom
they had been obliged to procure, simply gave him the breast,
evincing the gentle stupidity of a cow. The most devoted,
constant care and attention were needed, and Pauline had to
keep perpetual watch over the child. By the end of the
first month, however, the boy had happily acquired the
strength of a child born in due season, and gradually
developed. Still, he was but a little creature, and Pauline
never left him for a minute, more especially since the
weaning, which had been attended by much trouble.</p>

<p>'There!' she said, 'he can't take cold now. See, uncle,
how pretty he looks in this crimson rug! It makes him
quite rosy.'</p>

<p>Chanteau painfully turned his head, which was now the
only part of his body which he was able to move.</p>

<p>'If you kiss him,' he murmured, 'you will wake him.
Don't disturb the little cherub. Do you see that steamer
over there? It is coming from Havre. How fast it is
cutting along!'</p>

<p>Pauline watched the steamer in order to please him. It
looked like a black speck on the boundless waters; a slight
streak of smoke just blurred a point of the horizon. For a
short time the girl stood there, perfectly still, gazing at that
sea which slumbered so peacefully beneath the clear sky, and
enjoying the beauty of the day.</p>

<p>'But, while I'm stopping here, the stew is getting
burned!' she exclaimed at last, hurrying off towards the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Just as she was about to enter the house a voice called
from the first floor:</p>

<p>'Pauline!'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span></p>

<p>It was Louise, who was leaning out of the window of what
had once been Madame Chanteau's room, but which was now
occupied by herself and Lazare. She wore a loose jacket,
and her hair was hanging down. In querulous tones she
went on: 'If Lazare's down there, tell him to come upstairs.'</p>

<p>'No, he isn't here. He hasn't come back yet,' Pauline
replied.</p>

<p>At this Louise broke out angrily:</p>

<p>'I knew quite well that we shouldn't see him again till
this evening, even if he condescends to come back then. He
stayed away all night in spite of his express promise. Ah!
he's a nice fellow. When he once gets to Caen, there's no
getting him away from it!'</p>

<p>'He has so few amusements,' Pauline gently urged.
'And then this business about the manure would keep him
some time. No doubt he will take advantage of the Doctor's
gig, and come back in it.'</p>

<p>Since Lazare and Louise had settled down at Bonneville
they had lived a life of perpetual misunderstanding and
bickering. There were no open quarrels between them, but
constant signs of ill-temper, the lives of both being rendered
unhappy by want of harmony. Louise, after a long and
painful convalescence, was now leading an empty, aimless
existence, manifesting the greatest distaste for domestic
matters, and spending her time in novel-reading and protracted
toilets. Lazare had again fallen a prey to overwhelming
<i>ennui</i>; he never opened a book, but spent his
time in gazing abstractedly at the sea, just escaping to Caen
at long intervals, though only to return home more weary
than ever. Pauline, who had been obliged to retain the
management of the house, had become quite indispensable to
them, for she patched up their quarrels several times a day.</p>

<p>'Be quick and finish dressing!' added the girl. 'The
Abbé will be here directly, and you must come and sit with
him and my uncle. I have too much to do myself.'</p>

<p>But Louise could not rid herself of her rancour.</p>

<p>'How <i>can</i> he do it? Keeping away from home all this
time! My father wrote to me yesterday and told me that
the remainder of our money would go the same way as the
rest.'</p>

<p>Lazare had, indeed, allowed himself to be swindled in a
couple of unfortunate speculations, and Pauline had become
so anxious on the child's account that, as his godmother, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
had made him a present of two-thirds of what she still
possessed, taking out in his name a policy which would
assure him a hundred thousand francs on the day he reached
his majority. She now had only an income of five hundred
francs herself, but her sole regret in the matter was
the necessity she was under of curtailing her customary
charities.</p>

<p>'A fine speculation that manure business is!' Louise
continued. 'I am sure my father will have made him give it
up, and he's only stopping away to amuse himself. Oh,
well! I don't care! He may be as dissolute as he likes!'</p>

<p>'Then what are you getting so angry for?' Pauline
retorted. 'But you know that's all nonsense; the poor
fellow never thinks of anything wrong. Do hurry down,
won't you? What can have happened to Véronique, I
wonder, that she should disappear in this way on a Saturday,
and leave me all her work to do?'</p>

<p>In fact, a most extraordinary thing had happened&mdash;one
which had been puzzling the whole house since two o'clock.
Véronique had prepared the vegetables for the stew, and
plucked and trussed a duck; and then she had disappeared
as suddenly and completely as if the earth had swallowed her
up. Pauline, quite astounded by this sudden disappearance,
had at last resolved to undertake the cooking of the stew
herself.</p>

<p>'She hasn't come back, then?' asked Louise, recovering
from her anger.</p>

<p>'No, indeed!' Pauline replied. 'Do you know what I
am beginning to think? She bought the duck for forty sous
of a woman who happened to be passing, and I remember
telling her that I had seen much finer ones for thirty sous at
Verchemont. She tossed her head directly, and gave me
one of her surly looks. Well, I'll be bound that she has
gone to Verchemont to see if I wasn't telling a lie.'</p>

<p>She smiled, but there was a touch of sadness in her smile,
for the surliness which Véronique was again manifesting
pained her. The servant's gradually increasing ill-will
against Pauline since Madame Chanteau's death had now
brought her back to the virulence of the very early days.</p>

<p>'We've none of us been able to get a word out of her for
a week or more,' said Louise. 'Any sort of folly may be
expected from a person with such a disposition.'</p>

<p>'Well,' said Pauline charitably, 'we must excuse her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
whims. She is sure to come back again, and we shan't die
of hunger this time.'</p>

<p>But the baby now began to move about on the rug, and
she ran up and bent over it.</p>

<p>'Well! what is it, my dear?'</p>

<p>The mother, who was still at the window, glanced out for
a moment and then disappeared within the room. Chanteau,
quite absorbed in his own reflections, just turned his head as
Loulou began to bark, and then called out to his niece:</p>

<p>'Here are your visitors, Pauline!'</p>

<p>Two ragged young urchins, the advanced guard of the
troop which she received every Saturday, now came up.
Little Paul had quickly dropped off to sleep once more, and
she rose and said:</p>

<p>'It's a nice time for them to come! I haven't a minute
to spare. Well, never mind; stay, since you're here. Sit
down on the bench. And, uncle, if any more of them come,
please make them sit down by the side of these. I must just
go and glance at my stew.'</p>

<p>When she returned, at the end of a quarter of an hour,
two boys and two girls were already seated on the bench;
they were some of her little beggars of former days, but
had now grown much bigger, though they still retained their
mendicant habits.</p>

<p>Never before had there been so much distress in Bonneville.
During the storms in May the three remaining houses
had been crushed against the cliffs. The destruction was
now complete; the flood-tides had made a clean sweep of the
village after centuries of attack, during which the sea had
each year devoured one or another part of the place. On
the shingle one now only saw the conquering waves, which
effaced even all trace of the ruins. The fishermen, expelled
from the nook where for generation after generation they
had obstinately persisted in struggling against the ceaseless
onslaught, had been compelled to migrate further up the
ravine, where they were camping in companies. The richer
ones had built cabins for themselves, while the poorer ones
were taking refuge under rocks, all combining to found a new
Bonneville, from which their descendants would in turn be
ejected after fresh centuries of contest. Before it could
complete its work of destruction, the sea had found it necessary
to sweep the piles and stockades away. On the day of
their overthrow the wind had blown from the north, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
such huge mountains of water had dashed up that the church
itself had been shaken by the violence with which they broke
against the shore. Lazare, though he was told of what was
happening, would not go down. He had remained on the
terrace, watching the waves sweep up, while the fishermen
rushed off to view the desperate onslaught. They were
thrilled with mingled pride and awe. Ah! how the hussy
was howling! Now she was going to make a clean sweep
of it all! And in less than twenty minutes, indeed, everything
had disappeared, the stockades were broken down, and
the timbers were smashed into matchwood. And the fishermen
roared with the waves, and gesticulated and danced like
so many savages, intoxicated by the wind and the sea, and
glutting themselves with the sight of all that destruction.
Then, while Lazare angrily shook his fist at them, they had
fled for their lives, closely pursued by the wild rush of the
waves, which nothing more held in check. Now they were
perishing of starvation, and groaning as of old in their new
Bonneville, accusing the hussy of their ruin and commending
themselves to the charity of the 'kind young lady.'</p>

<p>'What are you doing there?' cried Pauline, as she
saw Houtelard's son. 'I forbade you ever to come here
again!'</p>

<p>He was a great strapping fellow, now nearly twenty years
old. His former sad and timid expression, that told of bad
treatment at home, had turned into a sly, crafty look. He
lowered his eyes as he replied:</p>

<p>'Please take pity upon us, Mademoiselle Pauline. We
are so miserable and wretched now that father is dead!'</p>

<p>Houtelard had gone off to sea one stormy evening and
had never returned. His body had never been found, nor
had that of his mate, nor even a single plank of their boat.
Pauline, however, obliged as she was to exercise strict supervision
over her charities, had sworn that she would never
give a single sou to either son or widow, for they lived
together in open shame.</p>

<p>'You know quite well why I won't have you coming
here,' Pauline replied. 'When you behave differently, I will
see what I can do for you.'</p>

<p>Thereupon the young fellow began to plead his cause in
a whining voice: 'It is all her fault; she brought it about.
She would have gone on beating me otherwise. Please give
us a trifle, kind young lady. We have lost everything. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
could get on well enough myself, but it is for her that I'm
asking you, and she is very ill&mdash;indeed she is; I swear it.'</p>

<p>Pauline ended by taking pity on him and sending him
away with a loaf of bread and some stew; and she even
promised to call on the sick woman and take her some
medicine.</p>

<p>'Medicine, indeed!' muttered Chanteau. 'Just you try
to get her to swallow it!'</p>

<p>But Pauline had already turned her attention to the
Prouane girl, one of whose cheeks was gashed.</p>

<p>'How have you managed to do that?'</p>

<p>'I fell against a tree, Mademoiselle Pauline.'</p>

<p>'Against a tree? It looks more like a cut from the corner
of a table.'</p>

<p>She was a big girl now, with prominent cheek-bones, but
she still had the great haggard eyes of a weak-witted child,
and she made vain efforts to remain standing in a respectful
attitude. Her legs shook under her, and she could scarcely
articulate her words.</p>

<p>'Why! you have been drinking, you wicked girl!' cried
Pauline, scrutinizing her keenly.</p>

<p>'Oh, Mademoiselle! how can you say so?'</p>

<p>'You were drunk and you fell down! Isn't it so? I
know very well what you are all given to. Sit down, and
I will go and get some arnica and a bandage.'</p>

<p>She attended to the girl's cheek, and tried to make her
feel ashamed of herself. It was disgraceful, she told her, for
a girl of her age to intoxicate herself with her father and
mother, a couple of drunkards who would be found dead
some morning, poisoned by calvados. The girl listened
drowsily, and when her cheek was bandaged she stammered
out:</p>

<p>'Father is always complaining of pains, and I could
rub him well if you would give me a little camphorated
brandy.'</p>

<p>Neither Pauline nor Chanteau could keep from laughing.</p>

<p>'No, no! I know very well what would become of the
brandy. I will give you a loaf, though I'm afraid you will
go and sell it and spend the money in drink. Stay where
you are, and Cuche shall take you home.'</p>

<p>Young Cuche got up from the bench in his turn. His
feet were bare; indeed, the only clothes he wore were some
old breeches and a ragged shirt, through which showed parts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
of his skin, browned by the sun and torn by brambles. He
was to be met running about the high-roads, leaping over
hedges with the agility of a wolf, living like a savage, to
whom hunger makes every sort of prey acceptable. He had
reached the lowest depths of misery and destitution, such an
abyss of wretchedness that Pauline looked at him with
remorse, as though she felt guilty for allowing a human
being to go on living in such a state. But whenever she
had attempted to rescue him, he had always fled, hating all
thought of work or service.</p>

<p>'Since you have come here again,' she said to him gently,
'I suppose you have thought over what I said to you last
Saturday. I hope that your return here is a sign that
you are not lost to all sense of what is right. You cannot
go on leading your present vagabond life; I am no longer
as rich as I was, and I cannot support you in idleness. Have
you made up your mind to accept my offer?'</p>

<p>Since the loss of her fortune Pauline had tried to make
up for her lack of money by interesting other charitable
people in her pensioners. Doctor Cazenove had at last succeeded
in obtaining the admission of Cuche's mother into
the hospital for incurables at Bayeux, and Pauline herself
held in reserve a sum of one hundred francs to provide an
outfit for the son, for whom she had found a berth among
the workmen employed on the railway line to Cherbourg. He
bent his head as she spoke, and listened to her with an
expression of distrust.</p>

<p>'It's quite settled, isn't it?' she continued. 'You will
accompany your mother, and then you will go to your post.'</p>

<p>But as she stepped towards him he sprang back. His
eyes, though downcast, never left her, and he seemed to
think that she was going to seize him by his wrists.</p>

<p>'What is the matter?' she asked in surprise.</p>

<p>Then, with a wild animal's uneasy glance, the lad murmured:
'You are going to take me and shut me up. I don't
want to go.'</p>

<p>All further attempts at persuasion were useless. He let
her continue talking, and appeared to admit the force of
her reasoning; but as soon as ever she moved he sprang
towards the gate, and with an obstinate shake of the head
refused her offers for his mother and for himself, preferring
freedom and starvation.</p>

<p>'Take yourself off, you lazy impostor!' Chanteau cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
at last in indignation. 'It is kindness thrown away,
troubling one's self about such a vagabond.'</p>

<p>Pauline's hands trembled as she thought of her wasted
charity, her failure to effect anything for this lad, who
insisted on remaining in misery.</p>

<p>'No, no! uncle,' she said, with an expression of despairing
tolerance, 'they are starving, and they must have some food
in spite of everything.'</p>

<p>She called Cuche back to her to give him, as on other
Saturdays, a loaf of bread and forty sous. But he backed
away from her, saying:</p>

<p>'Put it down on the ground and go away, and I will come
and pick it up.'</p>

<p>She did as he told her. Then he cautiously stepped
forward, casting suspicious glances around him. As soon as
he had picked up the forty sous and the loaf he ran off as
fast as his bare feet could carry him.</p>

<p>'The wild beast!' cried Chanteau. 'He will come and
murder us all one of these nights. It's just like that little
gaol-bird's daughter there. I would swear it was she who
stole my silk handkerchief the other day.'</p>

<p>He was speaking of the Tourmal girl, whose grandfather
had lately joined her father in gaol. She was now the only
one who was left on the bench with the little Prouane, who
was stupefied with drink. She got up, without any sign that
she had heard the charge of theft brought against her, and
she began to whine: 'Have pity upon us, kind young lady!
There is nobody but mother and me at home now. The
gendarmes come and beat us every night. My body is all
one big bruise, and mother is dying. Oh! kind young lady,
do give us some money and some good meat-soup and some
wine&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>Chanteau, quite exasperated by the girl's string of lies,
moved restlessly in his chair, but Pauline would have given
the chemise off her back.</p>

<p>'There! there! That will do,' she muttered. 'You
would get more if you talked less. Stay where you are, and
I will make up a basket for you.'</p>

<p>When she came back, bringing with her an old fish-hamper,
in which she had put a loaf, two litre-bottles of wine,
and some meat, she found another of her pensioners on the
terrace, the Gonin girl, who had brought her child with her,
a girl now some twenty months old. The mother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>
was sixteen years of age, was so fragile and slight of figure
that she seemed more like the child's elder sister. She was
scarcely able to carry the infant, but she nevertheless brought
it to the house, as she knew that Mademoiselle Pauline was
very fond of children and could refuse them nothing.</p>

<p>'Good gracious! How heavy she is!' cried Pauline, as
she took the child in her arms. 'And to think that she is not
six months older than our Paul!'</p>

<p>Despite herself, her eyes turned sadly towards the little
boy, who was still lying asleep upon the rug. However, the
young mother began to complain:</p>

<p>'If you only knew how much she eats, Mademoiselle
Pauline! And I've no bed-linen, and nothing to dress her
with. And then, since father is dead, mother and the other
one are always ill-using me. They treat me like the lowest
of the low, and say that if I have a baby I ought to provide
what it costs to keep it.'</p>

<p>'Poor little thing!' Pauline murmured. 'I am knitting
her some socks. You must bring her to see me oftener;
there is always milk here, and she might have a few spoonfuls
of gruel. I will go and see your mother, and I'll try to
frighten her, as she still behaves unkindly to you.'</p>

<p>The girl took up her daughter again, while Pauline
began to prepare a parcel.</p>

<p>However, Abbé Horteur now appeared upon the terrace.</p>

<p>'Here come Monsieur Lazare and the Doctor,' he
announced.</p>

<p>At the same moment they heard the wheels of the gig,
and while Martin, the ex-sailor with the wooden leg, was
leading the horse to the stable, Cazenove came round from
the yard, crying:</p>

<p>'I am bringing you back the rake who stopped away from
home all night. You won't be very hard on him, I hope!'</p>

<p>Lazare now appeared, smiling feebly. He was quickly
ageing; his shoulders were bent and his face was cadaverous,
devastated by the mental anguish which was destroying him.
He was no doubt on the point of explaining the reason of his
delay when the window of the first floor, which had remained
open, was violently closed.</p>

<p>'Louise hasn't quite finished dressing yet,' Pauline
explained. 'She will be down in a minute or two.'</p>

<p>They all looked at one another, and there was a feeling
of embarrassment. That angry banging of the window<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
portended a quarrel. After taking a step or two towards the
stairs, Lazare checked himself and determined to wait where
he was. He kissed his father and little Paul; and then, to
conceal his disquietude, he tackled his cousin, saying to her
in a querulous voice:</p>

<p>'Rid us of all this vermin! You know I can't bear to
see them anywhere near me.'</p>

<p>He was referring to the three girls who were still on the
bench. Pauline hastened to tie up the parcel which she had
made for the Gonin girl.</p>

<p>'There! you can go now,' she said. 'You two just take
your companion home, and mind she doesn't fall any more.
And, you, look well after your baby, and try not to forget it
or leave it anywhere on the road.'</p>

<p>As they were at last setting off Lazare insisted upon
examining the Tourmal girl's hamper. She had already
contrived to stow away in it an old coffee-pot, which had
been thrown aside in a corner and which she had managed
to steal. Then all three of the little hussies were driven
away, the young drunkard tottering along between the two
others.</p>

<p>'What a dreadful lot they are!' exclaimed the priest,
sitting down by Chanteau's side. 'God has certainly
abandoned them. Some have children directly after their
first Communion, and others take to drinking and thieving
like their parents. Ah, well! I've warned them of what will
happen to them some day!'</p>

<p>'I say, my dear fellow,' then began the Doctor, addressing
Lazare in an ironical tone, 'are you thinking of building
those famous stockades of yours over again?'</p>

<p>Lazare made an angry gesture. Any allusion to his
defeat in his struggle with the sea exasperated him.</p>

<p>'No indeed!' he cried. 'I would let the sea sweep into
our own house, without even putting a broom-handle across
the road to stay its course. No, no! indeed. I've been
very foolish as it is, but one doesn't commit that kind of
folly again. I actually saw those scoundrels dancing with
delight on the day of the catastrophe! Do you know what I
begin to think? I feel sure they had sawn through the
beams on the day before the flood-tide, for they would never
have given way as they did if they had not been tampered
with.'</p>

<p>He tried in this way to salve his wounded pride as an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
engineer. Then, stretching his hand towards Bonneville, he
added:</p>

<p>'Let them all go to smash! I will take my turn at
dancing then!'</p>

<p>'Don't say such wicked things!' Pauline observed in her
quiet manner. 'Only the poor may be excused for being
wicked. You ought to build up the stockade again in spite
of everything.'</p>

<p>Lazare had already calmed down, as though his last burst
of passion had exhausted him.</p>

<p>'No, no!' he muttered, 'it would bore me too much.
But you are right; there is nothing for one to make oneself
angry about. Whether they're drowned or not, what does it
matter to me?'</p>

<p>Silence fell again. Chanteau had fallen back into a
posture of dolorous immobility after raising his head to
receive his son's kiss. The priest was twirling his thumbs,
and the Doctor paced about, with his hands behind his back.
They all began to look at little Paul, whom Pauline defended
even from his father's caresses, to prevent him from being
wakened. Since the others had come she had begged them
to lower their voices and not to tread so heavily about the
rug, and she now shook a whip at Loulou, who still
continued to growl at the noise he had heard when the horse
was led to the stable.</p>

<p>'You don't suppose that that will quiet him, do you?'
said Lazare. 'He'll make that row for an hour. He's the
most disagreeable brute I ever came across. He begins to
snarl directly one moves, and one might as well be without a
dog at all, he is so completely absorbed in himself. The
only good the sulky beast does is to make us regret our poor
old Matthew.'</p>

<p>'How old is Minouche now?' Cazenove inquired. 'I
have seen her about here as long as I can remember.'</p>

<p>'She is turned sixteen,' Pauline answered, 'and she
keeps very well yet.'</p>

<p>Minouche, who was still at her toilet on the dining-room
window-sill, raised her head as the Doctor pronounced her
name. For a moment she held her foot suspended in the
air, then again began to lick her fur delicately.</p>

<p>'She isn't deaf yet, you see,' Pauline said; 'but I fancy
her sight is not so good as it was. It is scarcely a week ago
since seven kittens of hers were drowned. It is really quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>
terrible to think of the number she has had during the last
sixteen years. If they had all been allowed to live they
would have eaten up the whole neighbourhood.'</p>

<p>'Well, well, she at any rate keeps neat and clean,' said
the priest, glancing at Minouche as she continued washing
herself with her tongue.</p>

<p>Chanteau, who, like the others, was looking towards the
cat, now began to moan more loudly with that incessant
involuntary expression of pain which had become so habitual
to him that he had grown unconscious of it.</p>

<p>'Are you feeling worse?' the Doctor asked him.</p>

<p>'Eh? What? Why do you ask?' he said, suddenly
seeming to awake. 'Ah, it's because I'm breathing heavily.
Yes, I am in great pain this evening. I thought that the
sun would do me good, but I feel as though I were being
suffocated, and I haven't a joint that isn't burning.'</p>

<p>Cazenove examined his hands. They all shuddered at the
sight of those poor deformed stumps. The priest made
another of his sensible remarks.</p>

<p>'Such fingers as those are not adapted for playing
draughts. That's an amusement which you can't have
now.'</p>

<p>'Be very careful about what you eat and drink,' the
Doctor urged. 'Your elbow is highly inflamed, and the
ulceration is increasing.'</p>

<p>'How can I be more careful than I am?' Chanteau
wailed hopelessly. 'My wine is all measured out and my
meat is weighed! Must I give up taking anything at all?
Indeed, it isn't living to go on like this, and one might
as well die at once. I can't eat even without assistance&mdash;how
is it likely with such things as these at the end of my
arms?&mdash;and you may be quite sure that Pauline, who feeds
me, takes care that I don't get anything that I oughtn't
to have.'</p>

<p>The girl smiled.</p>

<p>'Ah! yes, indeed,' she said, 'you ate too much yesterday.
It was my fault, but I couldn't refuse when I saw how
your appetite was distressing you.'</p>

<p>At this they all pretended to grow merry, and began to
tease him about the junketings in which they declared he
still indulged. But their voices trembled with pity as they
glanced at that remnant of a man, that inert mass of flesh,
which now only lived enough to suffer. He had fallen back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
into his usual position, with his body leaning to the right and
his hands lying on his knees.</p>

<p>'This evening now, for instance,' Pauline continued,
'we are going to have a roast duck&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>But she suddenly checked herself to ask:</p>

<p>'By the way, did you see anything of Véronique as you
came through Verchemont?'</p>

<p>Then she told Lazare and the Doctor the story of
Véronique's disappearance. Neither of them had seen anything
of her. They expressed some astonishment at the
woman's strange whims, and ended by growing merry over
the subject. It would be a fine sight, they said, to see her
face when she came back and found them already round the
table with the dinner cooked and served.</p>

<p>'I must leave you now,' said Pauline gaily, 'for I have
to attend to the kitchen. If I let the stew get burnt, or serve
the duck underdone, my uncle will give me notice!'</p>

<p>Abbé Horteur broke out into a loud laugh, and even
Doctor Cazenove himself seemed tickled at the idea, when
the window on the first floor was suddenly thrown open with
a tremendous clatter. Louise did not show herself, but
merely called in a sharp voice:</p>

<p>'Come upstairs, Lazare!'</p>

<p>At first Lazare seemed inclined to rebel and to refuse
obedience to a command given in such a voice. But Pauline,
anxious to avoid a scene before visitors, gave him an entreating
look, and he went off to the house, while his cousin
remained for a moment or two longer on the terrace to do
what she could to dissipate the awkwardness of the situation.
No one spoke, and they all looked at the sea in embarrassment.
The westering sun was now casting a sheet of gold
over it, crowning the little blue waves with quivering fires.
Far away in the distance the horizon was changing to a soft
lilac hue. The lovely day was drawing towards its close in
perfect serenity, and not a cloud or a sail flecked the infinite
stretch of sky and sea.</p>

<p>'Well, as he never came home last night,' Pauline at
last ventured to say with a smile, 'I suppose it is necessary
to lecture him a little.'</p>

<p>The Doctor looked at her, and on his face also appeared a
smile, in which Pauline could read his prediction of former
days, when he had told her that she wasn't making them a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
very desirable present in bestowing them on one another.
And at this she walked away towards the kitchen.</p>

<p>'Well, I must really leave you now,' she said. 'Try to
amuse yourselves. Call for me, uncle, if Paul wakes up again.'</p>

<p>In the kitchen, when she had stirred the stew and got the
spit ready, she knocked the pots and pans about impatiently.
The voices of Louise and Lazare reached her more and more
distinctly through the ceiling, and she grew distressed as she
thought that they would certainly be heard on the terrace.
It was very absurd of them, she said to herself, to go on
shouting as though they were both deaf, and letting everybody
know of their disagreements. But she did not care to
go up to them, partly because she had to get the dinner
ready, and partly because she felt ill at ease at the thought
of interfering with them in their own room. It was generally
downstairs, amid the common life of the family, that she
played her part of reconciler.</p>

<p>She went into the dining-room for a few moments and
busied herself with laying the table. But the shouting still
continued, and she could no longer bear the thought that
they were making themselves unhappy. So, impelled by
that spirit of active charity which made the happiness of
others the chief thought of her life, she at last went upstairs.</p>

<p>'My dear children,' she exclaimed, as she abruptly
entered the room, 'I daresay you will tell me it is no business
of mine, but you are really making too much noise. It
is very foolish of you to excite yourselves in this way and
disturb the whole house.'</p>

<p>She had hastily stepped across the room, and at once
closed the window, which Louise had left open. Fortunately
neither the priest nor the Doctor had remained on the
terrace. With one quick glance she had seen that there was
nobody there except the drowsing Chanteau and little Paul,
who was still asleep.</p>

<p>'We could hear you out there as plainly as if you had
been in the dining-room,' she resumed. 'Come, now, what
is the matter this time?'</p>

<p>But, their tempers aroused, they continued quarrelling
without taking any notice of Pauline. She now stood there,
still and silent, feeling ill at ease again in that room. The
yellow cretonne with its green pattern, the old mahogany
furniture and the red carpet, had been replaced by heavy
woollen hangings and furniture more in harmony with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span>
Louise's delicacy of taste. There was nothing left to remind
one of the dead mother. A scent of heliotrope arose from
the toilet-table, on which lay some damp towels, and the
perfume somewhat oppressed Pauline. She involuntarily
glanced round the room, in which every object spoke of the
familiar life of husband and wife. Though, as her rebellious
thoughts calmed down, she had at last prevailed upon herself
to continue living with them, she had never previously entered
their room, where all things suggested conjugal privacy. And
thus she quivered almost with the jealousy of former times.</p>

<p>'How can you make each other so unhappy?' she murmured,
after a short interval of silence. 'Won't you ever be
sensible?'</p>

<p>'Well, no, I've had quite enough of it!' cried Louise.
'Do you think he will ever allow that he is in the wrong? I
merely told him how uneasy he had made us all by not coming
home last night, and then he flew at me like a wild beast
and accused me of having ruined his life, and threatened that
he would go off to America!'</p>

<p>Lazare interrupted her in furious tones:</p>

<p>'You are lying! If you had chided me for my absence in
that gentle fashion, I should have kissed you, and there would
have been an end of the matter. But it was you who accused
me of making you spend your life in tears. Yes, you threatened
to go and throw yourself into the sea, if I continued to
make your life unbearable.'</p>

<p>Then they flew at each other again, and gave vent to all
the bitterness which the continual jarring of their temperaments
aroused in them. The slightest little differences set
them bickering, and brought them to a state of exasperated
antipathy which made the rest of the day wretched. Whenever
her husband interfered with her enjoyment Louise,
despite her gentle face, proved as malicious as a fawning cat,
that loves to be caressed, but strikes out with its claws at the
slightest irritation; and Lazare, finding in these quarrels a
relief from his besetting <i>ennui</i>, frequently persisted in them
for the sake of the excitement they brought.</p>

<p>However, Pauline continued listening to the quarrel.
She was suffering greater unhappiness than they themselves
were. That fashion of loving one another was beyond her
comprehension. Why couldn't they make mutual allowances
and accommodate themselves to each other, since they had to
live together? She was deeply pained, for she still regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>
the marriage as her own work, and she longed to see it a
happy and harmonious one, so that she might feel compensated
for the sacrifice she had made by knowing that she had, at any
rate, acted rightly.</p>

<p>'I never reproach you for squandering my fortune,'
Louise continued.</p>

<p>'There was only that accusation wanting!' Lazare cried.
'It wasn't my fault that I was robbed of it.'</p>

<p>'Oh! it's only stupid folks who allow their pockets to be
emptied, who are robbed. But, any way, we are now reduced
to a wretched income of four or five thousand francs, barely
sufficient to enable us to live in this hole of a place. If it
were not for Pauline, our child would have to go naked one of
these days, for I quite expect that you will squander all that
we have left, what with all your extraordinary fads and speculations
that come to grief one after the other.'</p>

<p>'There! there! Prate away! Your father has already
paid me similar pretty compliments. I guessed you had been
writing to him. I've given up that speculation in manure in
consequence; though I know it was a perfectly safe thing,
with cent. per cent. to be gained. But now I'm like you, and
I've had enough of it, and the deuce take me if I bestir myself
any more. We will go on living here.'</p>

<p>'A pretty life, isn't it, for a woman of my age? It's
nothing but a gaol, with never an opportunity of going out or
seeing anybody; and there's that stupid sea for ever in front
of one, which only seems to increase one's <i>ennui</i>&mdash;&mdash;Oh! if
I had only known! If I had only known!'</p>

<p>'And do you suppose that I enjoy myself here? If I were
not married, I should be able to go away to some distant
place and try my fortune. I have longed to do so a score of
times. But that's all at an end now; I'm nailed down to this
lonely wilderness, where there's nothing to do but to go to
sleep. You have done for me; I feel that very clearly.'</p>

<p>'I have done for you! I!&mdash;I didn't force you to marry me,
did I? It was you who ought to have seen that we were not
suited to each other. It is your fault if our lives are wrecked.'</p>

<p>'Ah! yes, indeed, our lives are certainly wrecked, and you
do all you can to make them more intolerable every day.'</p>

<p>Pauline, though she had resolved not to interfere between
them, could no longer restrain herself.</p>

<p>'Oh! do give over, you unhappy creatures! You seem to
take a pleasure in marring a life which might be such a happy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
one. Why will you goad each other into saying things
which you cannot recall and which make you so wretched?
Hold your tongues, both of you! I won't let this go on any
longer.'</p>

<p>Louise had fallen into a chair in a fit of tears, while
Lazare, in a state of wild excitement, strode up and down the
room.</p>

<p>'Crying won't do any good, my dear,' Pauline continued.
'You are really not tolerant; you have too many grievances.
And you, my poor fellow, how can you treat her in this
unkind fashion? It is abominable of you. I thought that, at
any rate, you had a kind heart. You are, both of you, a
couple of overgrown children, and are equally in fault, making
yourselves wretched without knowing why. But I won't
have it any longer, do you hear? I won't have unhappy
people about me. Go and kiss each other at once!'</p>

<p>She tried to laugh; she no longer felt that tremor which
had at first so disquieted her. She was only thrilled by a
glow of kindliness, a desire to see them in each other's arms,
so that she might be sure their quarrel was at an end.</p>

<p>'Kiss him, indeed! I should just think so!' exclaimed
Louise. 'He has insulted me too much!'</p>

<p>'Never!' exclaimed Lazare.</p>

<p>Then Pauline broke into a merry laugh.</p>

<p>'Come, come!' she said; 'don't sulk with each other.
You know, I am very determined about having my own way.
The dinner is getting burnt, and our guests are waiting. If
you don't do as I tell you, Lazare, I shall come and make
you. Go down on your knees before her, and clasp her affectionately
to your heart. No, no! you must do it better than
that!'</p>

<p>She made them twine their arms closely and lovingly
about each other, and watched them kiss, with an air of joyful
triumph, without the least sign of trouble in her clear, calm
eyes. Within her glowed warm, thrilling joy, like some subtle
fire, which raised her high above them. Lazare pressed his
wife to his heart in remorse; and Louise, who was still in
her dressing-wrap, with her neck and arms bare, returned
his caresses, her tears streaming forth more freely than
before.</p>

<p>'There! that's much nicer, isn't it, than quarrelling?'
said Pauline. 'I will be off, now that you no longer need me
to make peace between you.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p>She sprang to the door as she spoke, and quickly closed it
upon that chamber of love, with its perfume of heliotrope,
which now thrilled her with soft emotion, as though it were
an accomplice perfume which would complete her task of
reconciliation.</p>

<p>When she got downstairs to the kitchen, Pauline began to
sing as she stirred her stew. Then she threw a bundle of
wood on the fire, arranged the turnspit, and began to watch
the duck roast with a critical eye. It amused her to have to
play the servant's part. She had tied a big white apron round
her, and felt quite pleased at the thought of waiting upon
them all and undertaking the most humble duties, so that she
might be able to tell them that they were that day indebted
to her for their gaiety and health. Now that, thanks to her,
they were smiling and happy, she wanted to serve them a
festive repast of very good things, of which they would partake
plentifully while growing bright and mirthful round the
table.</p>

<p>She thought, however, of her uncle and the child again,
and hastily ran out on to the terrace, where she was greatly
astonished to find her cousin seated by the side of his little
son.</p>

<p>'What!' she exclaimed, 'have you come down already?'</p>

<p>He merely nodded his head in answer. He seemed to
have fallen back into his former weary indifference; his
shoulders were bent, and his hands were lying listlessly in
front of him. Then Pauline said to him with an expression
of uneasy anxiety:</p>

<p>'I hope you didn't begin again as soon as my back was
turned?'</p>

<p>'No, no!' he at last made up his mind to reply. 'She
will be down as soon as she has put on her dress. We have
quite forgiven each other and made it up. But how long will
it last? To-morrow there will be something else; every day,
every hour! You can't change people, and you can't prevent
things happening.'</p>

<p>Pauline became very grave, and her saddened eyes sought
the ground. Lazare was right. She could clearly foresee a
long series of days like this in store for them, the same incessant
quarrels, which she would have to smooth away. And
she was no longer quite sure that she was altogether cured
herself, and might not again give way to her old outbursts of
jealousy. Ah! were these daily troubles never to have an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
end? But she had already raised her eyes again; she remembered
how many times she had won the victory over herself;
and as for those other two, she would see whether they would
not grow tired of quarrelling before she did of reconciling
them. This thought brightened her, and she laughingly
repeated it to Lazare. What would be left for her to do, if
the house became perfectly happy? She would fall a victim
to <i>ennui</i> herself, if she hadn't some little worries to smooth
away.</p>

<p>'Where are the priest and the Doctor?' she asked, surprised
to see them no longer there.</p>

<p>'They must have gone into the kitchen garden,' said
Chanteau. 'The Abbé wanted to show our pears to the
Doctor.'</p>

<p>Pauline was going to look from the corner of the terrace,
when she stopped short before little Paul.</p>

<p>'Ah! He has woke up again!' she cried. 'Just look at
him! He's already trying to be off on the loose!'</p>

<p>Paul had just pulled himself up on to his little knees in
the midst of the rug, and was beginning to creep off slyly
upon all fours. Before he reached the gravel, however, he
tripped over a fold in the rug, and rolled upon his back,
with his frock thrown back and his little legs and arms in
the air. He lay kicking about and wriggling amidst the
poppy-like brilliance of the rug.</p>

<p>'Well! he's kicking in a fine way!' cried Pauline merrily.
'Look, and you shall see how he has improved in his walking
since yesterday.'</p>

<p>She knelt down beside the child and tried to set him on
his feet. He had developed so slowly that he was very backward
for his age, and they had for a time feared that he would
always be weak on his legs. So it was a great joy to the
family to see him make his first attempts at walking, clutching
at the air with his hands, and tumbling down over the
smallest bit of gravel.</p>

<p>'Come now! give over playing,' Pauline called to him.
'Come and show them that you are a man. There now, keep
steady, and go and kiss papa, and then you shall go and kiss
grandfather.'</p>

<p>Chanteau, whose face was twitching with sharp shooting
pains, turned his head to watch the scene. Lazare, notwithstanding
his despondency, was willing to lend himself to the
fun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p>'Come along!' he cried to the child.</p>

<p>'Oh! you must hold out your arms to him,' Pauline explained.
'He won't venture if you don't. He likes to see
something that he can fall against. Come, my treasure,
pluck up a little courage!'</p>

<p>There were three steps for him to take. There were loving
exclamations and unbounded enthusiasm when Paul made up
his mind to go that little distance, with all the swaying of a
tight-rope walker who feels uncertain of his legs. He fell
into the arms of his father, who kissed him on his still scanty
hair, while he smiled with an infant's vague delighted smile,
widely opening his moist and rosy little mouth. Then his
godmother wanted to make him talk, but his tongue was still
more backward than his legs, and he only uttered guttural
sounds in which his relatives alone could distinguish the
words 'papa' and 'mamma.'</p>

<p>'Oh! but there's something else yet,' Pauline resumed.
'He promised to go and kiss his grandfather. Go along with
you! Ah! it's a fine walk you've got before you this time!'</p>

<p>There were at least eight steps between Lazare's chair and
Chanteau's. Paul had never ventured so far out into the
world before, and so there was considerable excitement about
the matter. Pauline took up a position half-way in order to
prevent accidents, and two long minutes were spent in persuading
the child to make a start. At last he set off, swaying about,
with his hands clutching the air. For an instant Pauline
thought that she would have to catch him in her arms, but
he pushed bravely forward and fell upon Chanteau's knees.
Bursts of applause greeted him.</p>

<p>Then they made him repeat the journey half a score of
times. He no longer showed any signs of fear; he started
off at the first call, went from his grandfather to his
father, and then back again to his grandfather, laughing
loudly all the time, and quite enjoying the fun, though he
always seemed on the point of tumbling over, as if the
ground were shaking beneath him.</p>

<p>'Just once again to father!' Pauline cried.</p>

<p>Lazare was beginning to get a little tired. Children, even
his own, quickly bored him. As he looked at his boy, so
merry and now out of danger, the thought flashed through
his mind that this little creature would outlive him and
would doubtless close his eyes for the last time, an idea which
made him shudder with agony. Since he had come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
determination to continue vegetating at Bonneville, he was
constantly occupied with the thought that he would die in
the room where his mother had died; and he never went up
the stairs without telling himself that one day his coffin
would pass that way. The entrance to the passage was very
narrow, and there was an awkward turning, which was a
perpetual source of disquietude to him, and he worried
himself with wondering how the bearers would be able to
carry him out without jolting him. As increasing age day by
day shortened his span of life, that constant dwelling upon
the thought of death hastened his breaking-up, annihilated
his last shreds of manliness. He was 'quite done for,' as he
often told himself; he was of no further use at all, and he
would ask himself what was the good of bestirring himself,
as he fell deeper and deeper into the slough of boredom.</p>

<p>'Just once more to grandfather!' cried Pauline.</p>

<p>Chanteau was not able to stretch out his arms to receive
and support his grandson, and, though he set his knees apart,
the clutching of the child's puny fingers at his trousers drew
sighs of pain from him. The little one was already used to
the old man's ceaseless moaning, and probably imagined, in
his scarcely awakened mind, that all grandfathers suffered in
the same way. That day, however, in the bright sunshine,
as he came and fell against him, he raised his little face,
checked his laugh, and gazed at the old man with his
vacillating eyes. The grandfather's deformed hands looked
like hideous blocks of mingled flesh and chalk; his face,
dented with red wrinkles, disfigured by suffering, seemed to
have been violently twisted towards his right shoulder;
while his whole body was covered with bumps and crevices,
as if it were that of some old stone saint, damaged and badly
pieced together. Paul appeared quite surprised to see him
looking so ill and so old in the sunshine.</p>

<p>'Just once more! Just once more!' cried Pauline again.</p>

<p>She, full of health and cheerfulness, kept sending the
little lad to and fro between the two men, from the grandfather,
who obstinately lived on in hopeless suffering, to
the father, who was already undermined by terror of the
hereafter.</p>

<p>'Perhaps his generation will be a less foolish one than
this,' she suddenly exclaimed. 'He won't accuse chemistry
of spoiling his life; he will believe that it is still possible to
live, even with the certainty of having some day to die.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span></p>

<p>Lazare smiled in an embarrassed way.</p>

<p>'Bah!' he muttered, 'he will have the gout like my
father, and his nerves will be worse strung than mine. Just
see how weak he is! It is the law of degeneration.'</p>

<p>'Be quiet!' cried Pauline. 'I will bring him up, and
you'll see if I don't make a man of him!'</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence, while she clasped the child
to her in a motherly embrace.</p>

<p>'Why don't you get married, as you're so fond of
children?' Lazare asked.</p>

<p>She looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>'But I have a child! Haven't you given me one? I get
married! Never! What an idea!'</p>

<p>She dandled little Paul in her arms, and laughed yet
more loudly as she declared that Lazare had quite converted
her to the doctrines of the great Saint Schopenhauer, and
that she would remain unmarried in order to be able to
work for the universal deliverance. And she was, indeed,
the incarnation of renunciation, of love for others and kindly
charity for erring humanity.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking to rest in the boundless waters,
perfect serenity fell from the paling sky, the immensity of air
and sea alike lay wrapped in all the mellow softness of the
close of a lovely day. Far away over the water one single
little white sail gleamed like a spark, but it vanished as the
sun sank beneath the long line of the horizon; then there
was nothing to be seen save the gradual deepening of the
twilight over the motionless sea. And Pauline was still
dandling the child, and laughing with brave gaiety as she
stood between her despairing cousin and her moaning uncle,
in the middle of the terrace, which was now growing bluish
in the shadowy dusk. She had stripped herself of everything,
but happiness rang out in her clear laugh.</p>

<p>'Aren't we going to dine this evening?' asked Louise,
making her appearance in a coquettish dress of grey silk.</p>

<p>'I'm quite ready,' Pauline replied. 'I can't think what
they can be doing in the garden.'</p>

<p>At that moment Abbé Horteur came back, looking very
much distressed. In reply to their anxious questions, after
seeking for some phrase which would soften the shock, he
ended by bluntly saying:</p>

<p>'We have just discovered poor Véronique hanging from
one of your pear-trees.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p>They all raised a cry of surprise and horror, and their
faces paled beneath the passing quiver of death.</p>

<p>'But what could make her do such a thing?' cried Pauline.
'She could have had no reason, and she had even to
prepare the dinner. It can scarcely be because I told her
that they had made her pay ten sous too much for her duck!'</p>

<p>In his turn Doctor Cazenove now came up. For the
last quarter of an hour he had been vainly trying to restore
animation to the poor woman's body in the coach-house,
whither Martin had helped him to carry it. One could never
tell, he said, what such whimsical old servants would do. She
had never really got over her mistress's death.</p>

<p>'It didn't take her long,' he added. 'She just strung
herself up by the strings of one of her kitchen aprons.'</p>

<p>Lazare and Louise, frozen with terror, said not a word.
Chanteau, after listening in silence, felt a pang of disgust as
he thought of the compromised dinner. And that wretched
creature without hands or feet, who had to be put to bed and
fed like a child, that pitiable remnant of a man, whose
almost vanished life was nothing more than one scream of
pain, cried out in furious indignation:</p>

<p>'What a fool one must be to go and kill oneself!'</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
