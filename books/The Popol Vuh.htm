<p class="first">The &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is the New World&rsquo;s
richest mythological mine. No translation of it has as yet appeared in
English, and no adequate translation in any European language. It has
been neglected to a certain extent because of the unthinking strictures
passed upon its authenticity. That other manuscripts exist in Guatemala
than the one discovered by Ximenes and transcribed by Scherzer and
Brasseur de Bourbourg is probable. So thought Brinton, and the present
writer shares his belief. And ere it is too late it would be well that
these&mdash;the only records of the faith of the builders of the mystic
ruined and deserted cities of Central America&mdash;should be
recovered. This is not a matter that should be left to the enterprise
of individuals, but one which should engage the consideration of
interested governments; for what is myth to-day is often history
to-morrow.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first xd26e140">[<i>The numbers in the text refer to notes at
the end of the study</i>]</p>
<p>There is no document of greater importance to the study of the
pre-Columbian mythology of America than the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo; It
is the chief source of our knowledge of the mythology of the
Kich&eacute; people of Central America, and it is further of
considerable comparative value when studied in conjunction with the
mythology of the Nahuatlac&acirc;, or Mexican peoples. This interesting
text, the recovery of which forms one of the most romantic episodes in
the history of American bibliography, was written by a Christianised
native of Guatemala some time in the seventeenth century, and was
copied in the Kich&eacute; language, in which it was originally
written, by a monk of the Order of Predicadores, one Francisco Ximenes,
who also added a Spanish translation and scholia.</p>
<p>The Abb&eacute; Brasseur de Bourbourg, a profound student of
American arch&aelig;ology and languages (whose euhemeristic
interpretations of the Mexican <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href=
"#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>myths are as worthless as the priceless
materials he unearthed are valuable) deplored, in a letter to the Duc
de Valmy,<a class="noteref" id="xd26e151src" href="#xd26e151" name=
"xd26e151src">1</a> the supposed loss of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh,&rdquo;
which he was aware had been made use of early in the nineteenth century
by a certain Don Felix Cabrera. Dr. C. Scherzer, an Austrian scholar,
thus made aware of its value, paid a visit to the Republic of Guatemala
in 1854 or 1855, and was successful in tracing the missing manuscript
in the library of the University of San Carlos in the city of
Guatemala. It was afterwards ascertained that its scholiast, Ximenes,
had deposited it in the library of his convent at Chichicastenango,
whence it passed to the San Carlos library in 1830.</p>
<p>Scherzer at once made a copy of the Spanish translation of the
manuscript, which he published at Vienna in 1856 under the title of
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Las Historias del origen de los Indios de
Guatemala, par el R. P. F. Francisco Ximenes.</span>&rdquo; The
Abb&eacute; Brasseur also took a copy of the original, which he
published at Paris in 1861, with the title &ldquo;<span lang="fr">Vuh
Popol: Le Livre Sacr&eacute; de Quich&eacute;s, et les Mythes de
l&rsquo;Antiquit&eacute; Am&eacute;ricaine.</span>&rdquo; In this work
the Kich&eacute; original and the Abbe&rsquo;s French translation are
set forth side by side. Unfortunately both the Spanish and the French
translations leave much to be desired so far as their accuracy is
concerned, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>and they are rendered of little use by reason of the
misleading notes which accompany them.</p>
<p>The name &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; signifies &ldquo;Record of the
Community,&rdquo; and its literal translation is &ldquo;Book of the
Mat,&rdquo; from the Kich&eacute; word &ldquo;pop&rdquo; or
&ldquo;popol,&rdquo; a mat or rug of woven rushes or bark on which the
entire family sat, and &ldquo;vuh&rdquo; or &ldquo;uuh,&rdquo; paper or
book, from &ldquo;uoch&rdquo; to write. The &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is
an example of a world-wide genre&mdash;a type of annals of which the
first portion is pure mythology, which gradually shades off into pure
history, evolving from the hero-myths of saga to the recital of the
deeds of authentic personages. It may, in fact, be classed with the
Heimskringla of Snorre, the Danish History of Saxo-Grammaticus, the
Chinese History in the Five Books, the Japanese &ldquo;Nihongi,&rdquo;
and, so far as its fourth book is concerned, it somewhat resembles the
Pictish Chronicle.</p>
<p>The language in which the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; was written, was,
as has been said, the Kich&eacute;, a dialect of the great
Maya-Kich&eacute; tongue spoken at the time of the Conquest from the
borders of Mexico on the north to those of the present State of
Nicaragua on the south; but whereas the Mayan was spoken in Yucatan
proper, and the State of Chiapas, the Kich&eacute; was the tongue of
the peoples of that part of Central America now occupied by the States
of Guatemala, Honduras and San <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href=
"#pb8" name="pb8">8</a>]</span>Salvador, where it is still used by the
natives. It is totally different to the Nahuatl, the language of the
people of Anahuac or Mexico, both as regards its origin and structure,
and its affinities with other American tongues are even less distinct
than the those between the Slavonic and Teutonic groups. Of this tongue
the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is practically the only monument; at all
events the only work by a native of the district in which it was used.
A cognate dialect, the Cakchiquel, produced the &ldquo;Annals&rdquo; of
that people, otherwise known as &ldquo;The Book of Chilan Balam,&rdquo;
a work purely of genealogical interest, which may be consulted in the
admirable translation of the late Daniel G. Brinton.</p>
<p>The Kich&eacute; people at the time of their discovery, which was
immediately subsequent to the fall of Mexico, had in part lost that
culture which was characteristic of the Mayan race, the remnants of
which have excited universal wonder in the ruins of the vast desert
cities of Central America<a href="#note1" id="nm1" name=
"nm1"><sup>1</sup></a>. At a period not far distant from the Conquest
the once centralised Government of the Mayan peoples had been broken up
into petty States and Confederacies, which in their character recall
the city-states of medi&aelig;val Italy. In all probability the
civilisation possessed by these peoples had been brought them by a race
from Mexico called the Toltecs<a href="#note2" id="nm2" name=
"nm2"><sup>2</sup></a>, who taught them the arts of building in stone
and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name=
"pb9">9</a>]</span>writing in hieroglyphics, and who probably
influenced their mythology most profoundly. The Toltecs were not,
however, in any way cognate with the Mayans, and were in all likelihood
rapidly absorbed by them. The Mayans were notably an agricultural
people, and it is not impossible that in their country the maize-plant
was first cultivated with the object of obtaining a regular cereal
supply<a href="#note3" id="nm3" name="nm3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Such, then, were the people whose mythology produced the body of
tradition and mythi-history known as the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo;; and
ere we pass to a consideration of their beliefs, their gods, and their
religious affinities, it will be well to summarise the three books of
it which treat of these things, as fully as space will permit, using
for that purpose both the French translation of Brasseur and the
Spanish one of Ximenes.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The First Book</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Over a universe wrapped in the gloom of a dense and
primeval night passed the god Hurakan, the mighty wind. He called out
&ldquo;earth,&rdquo; and the solid land appeared. The chief gods took
counsel; they were Hurakan, Gucumatz, the serpent covered with green
feathers, and Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, the mother and father gods. As the
result of their deliberations animals were created. But as yet
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb10" href="#pb10" name=
"pb10">10</a>]</span>man was not. To supply the deficiency the divine
beings resolved to create mannikins carved out of wood. But these soon
incurred the displeasure of the gods, who, irritated by their lack of
reverence, resolved to destroy them. Then by the will of Hurakan, the
Heart of Heaven, the waters were swollen, and a great flood came upon
the mannikins of wood. They were drowned and a thick resin fell from
heaven. The bird Xecotcovach tore out their eyes; the bird Camulatz cut
off their heads; the bird Cotzbalam devoured their flesh; the bird
Tecumbalam broke their bones and sinews and ground them into powder.
Because they had not thought on Hurakan, therefore the face of the
earth grew dark, and a pouring rain commenced, raining by day and by
night. Then all sorts of beings, great and small, gathered together to
abuse the men to their faces. The very household utensils and animals
jeered at them, their mill-stones, their plates, their cups, their
dogs, their hens. Said the dogs and hens, &ldquo;Very badly have you
treated us, and you have bitten us. Now we bite you in turn.&rdquo;
Said the mill-stones (metates<a class="noteref" id="xd26e196src" href=
"#xd26e196" name="xd26e196src">2</a>), &ldquo;Very much were we
tormented by you, and daily, daily, night and day, it was
<i>squeak</i>, <i>screech</i>, <i>screech</i>,<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e209src" href="#xd26e209" name="xd26e209src">3</a> for
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href="#pb11" name=
"pb11">11</a>]</span>your sake. Now you shall feel our strength, and we
will grind your flesh and make meal of your bodies.&rdquo; And the dogs
upbraided the mannikins because they had not been fed, and tore the
unhappy images with their teeth. And the cups and dishes said,
&ldquo;Pain and misery you gave us, smoking our tops and sides, cooking
us over the fire, burning and hurting us as if we had no feeling. Now
it is your turn, and you shall burn.&rdquo; Then ran the mannikins
hither and thither in despair. They climbed to the roofs of the houses,
but the houses crumbled under their feet; they tried to mount to the
tops of the trees, but the trees hurled them from them; they sought
refuge in the caverns, but the caverns closed before them. Thus was
accomplished the ruin of this race, destined to be overthrown. And it
is said that their posterity are the little monkeys who live in the
woods.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Myth of Vukub-Cakix</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After this catastrophe, ere yet the earth was quite
recovered from the wrath of the gods, there existed a man &ldquo;full
of pride,&rdquo; whose name was Vukub-Cakix. The name signifies
&ldquo;Seven-times-the-colour-of-fire,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Very
brilliant,&rdquo; and was justified by the fact that its owner&rsquo;s
eyes were of silver, his teeth of emerald, and other parts of his
anatomy of precious metals. In his own opinion <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb12" href="#pb12" name=
"pb12">12</a>]</span>Vukub-Cakix&rsquo;s existence rendered unnecessary
that of the sun and the moon, and this egoism so disgusted the gods
that they resolved upon his overthrow. His two sons, Zipacna and
Cabrakan (earth-heaper<a class="noteref" id="xd26e222src" href=
"#xd26e222" name="xd26e222src">4</a> (?) and earthquake), were daily
employed, the one in heaping up mountains, and the other in demolishing
them, and these also incurred the wrath of the immortals. Shortly after
the decision of the deities the twin hero-gods Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque
came to earth with the intention of chastising the arrogance of
Vukub-Cakix and his progeny.</p>
<p>Now Vukub-Cakix had a great tree of the variety known in Central
America as &ldquo;nanze&rdquo; or &ldquo;tapal,&rdquo; bearing a fruit
round, yellow, and aromatic, and upon this fruit he depended for his
daily sustenance. One day on going to partake of it for his morning
meal he mounted to its summit in order to espy the choicest fruits,
when to his great indignation he discovered that Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque
had been before him, and had almost denuded the tree of its produce.
The hero-gods, who lay concealed within the foliage, now added injury
to theft by hurling at Vukub-Cakix a dart from a blow-pipe, which had
the effect of precipitating him from the summit of the tree to the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb13" href="#pb13" name=
"pb13">13</a>]</span>earth. He arose in great wrath, bleeding profusely
from a severe wound in the jaw. Hun-Ahpu then threw himself upon
Vukub-Cakix, who in terrible anger seized the god by the arm and
wrenched it from the body. He then proceeded to his dwelling, where he
was met and anxiously interrogated by his spouse Chimalmat. Tortured by
the pain in his teeth and jaw he, in an <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e229" title="Source: access">excess</span> of spite, hung
Hun-Ahpu&rsquo;s arm over a blazing fire, and then threw himself down
to bemoan his injuries, consoling himself, however, with the idea that
he had adequately avenged himself upon the interlopers who had dared to
disturb his peace.</p>
<p>But Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque were in no mind that he should escape so
easily, and the recovery of Hun-Ahpu&rsquo;s arm must be made at all
hazards. With this end in view they consulted two venerable beings in
whom we readily recognise the father-mother divinities, Xpiyacoc and
Xmucane<a href="#note4" id="nm4" name="nm4"><sup>4</sup></a>, disguised
for the nonce as sorcerers. These personages accompanied Hun-Ahpu and
Xbalanque to the abode of Vukub-Cakix, whom they found in a state of
intense agony. The ancients persuaded him to be operated upon in order
to relieve his sufferings, and for his glittering teeth they
substituted grains of maize. Next they removed his eyes of emerald,
upon which his death speedily followed, as did that of his wife
Chimalmat. Hun-Ahpu&rsquo;s arm was <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14"
href="#pb14" name="pb14">14</a>]</span>recovered, re-affixed to his
shoulder, and all ended satisfactorily for the hero-gods.</p>
<p>But their mission was not yet complete. The sons of Vukub-Cakix,
Zipacna and Cabrakan, remained to be accounted for. Zipacna consented,
at the entreaty of four hundred youths, incited by the hero-gods, to
assist them in transporting a huge tree which was destined for the
roof-tree of a house they were building. Whilst assisting them he was
beguiled by them into entering a great ditch which they had dug for the
purpose of destroying him, and when once he descended was overwhelmed
by tree-trunks by his treacherous acquaintances, who imagined him to be
slain. But he took refuge in a side-tunnel of the excavation, cut off
his hair and nails for the ants to carry up to his enemies as a sign of
his death, waited until the youths had become intoxicated with pulque
because of joy at his supposed demise, and then, emerging from the pit,
shook the house that the youths had built over his body about their
heads, so that all were destroyed in its ruins.</p>
<p>But Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque were grieved that the four hundred had
perished, and laid a more efficacious trap for Zipacna. The
mountain-bearer, carrying the mountains by night, sought his sustenance
by day by the shore of the river, where he lived upon fish and crabs.
The hero-gods constructed an artificial crab which <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15" name="pb15">15</a>]</span>they
placed in a cavern at the bottom of a deep ravine. The hungry titan
descended to the cave, which he entered on all-fours. But a
neighbouring mountain had been undermined by the divine brothers, and
its bulk was cast upon him. Thus at the foot of Mount Meavan perished
the proud &ldquo;Mountain Maker,&rdquo; whose corpse was turned into
stone by the catastrophe.</p>
<p>Of the family of boasters only Cabrakan remained. Discovered by the
hero-gods at his favourite pastime of overturning the hills, they
enticed him in an easterly direction, challenging him to overthrow a
particularly high mountain. On the way they shot a bird with their
blow-pipes, and poisoned it with earth. This they gave to Cabrakan to
eat. After partaking of the poisoned fare his strength deserted him,
and failing to move the mountain he was bound and buried by the
victorious hero-gods.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Second Book</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Mystery veils the commencement of the Second Book of
the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo; The theme is the birth and family of
Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque, and the scribe intimates that only half is to
be told concerning the history of their father. Xpiyacoc and Xmucane,
the father and mother deities, had two sons, Hunhun-Ahpu and
Vukub-Hunahpu, the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb16" href="#pb16"
name="pb16">16</a>]</span>first being, so far as can be gathered, a
bi-sexual personage. He had by a wife, Xbakiyalo, two sons, Hunbatz and
Hunchouen, men full of wisdom and artistic genius. All of them were
addicted to the recreation of dicing and playing at ball, and a
spectator of their pastimes was Voc, the messenger of Hurakan.
Xbakiyalo having died, Hunhun-Ahpu and Vukub-Hunahpu, leaving the
former&rsquo;s sons behind, played a game of ball which in its progress
took them into the vicinity of the realm of Xibalba (the underworld).
This reached the ears of the monarchs of that place, Hun-Came and
Vukub-Came, who, after consulting their counsellors, challenged the
strangers to a game of ball, with the object of defeating and
disgracing them.</p>
<p>For this purpose they dispatched four messengers in the shape of
owls. The brothers accepted the challenge, after a touching farewell
with their mother Xmucane, and their sons and nephews, and followed the
feathered heralds down the steep incline to Xibalba from the playground
at Ninxor Carchah.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e259src" href="#xd26e259"
name="xd26e259src">5</a> After an ominous crossing over a river of
blood they came to the residence of the kings of Xibalba, where they
underwent the mortification of mistaking two wooden figures for the
monarchs. Invited to sit on the seat of honour, they discovered it to
be a red-hot stone, and the contortions which resulted from their
successful trick <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb17" href="#pb17" name=
"pb17">17</a>]</span>caused unbounded merriment among the Xibalbans.
Then they were thrust into the House of Gloom, where they were
sacrificed and buried. The head of Hunhun-Ahpu was, however, suspended
from a tree, which speedily became covered with gourds, from which it
was almost impossible to distinguish the bloody trophy. All in Xibalba
were forbidden the fruit of that tree.</p>
<p>But one person in Xibalba had resolved to disobey the mandate. This
was the virgin princess Xquiq (Blood), the daughter of Cuchumaquiq, who
went unattended to the spot. Standing under the branches gazing at the
fruit, the maiden stretched out her hand, and the head of Hunhun-Ahpu
spat into the palm. The spittle caused her to conceive, and she
returned home, being assured by the head of the hero-god that no harm
should result to her. This thing was done by order of Hurakan, the
Heart of Heaven. In six months&rsquo; time her father became aware of
her condition, and despite her protestations the royal messengers of
Xibalba, the owls, received orders to kill her and return with her
heart in a vase. She, however, escaped by bribing the owls with
splendid promises for the future to spare her and substitute for her
heart the coagulated sap of the blood-wart.</p>
<p>In her extremity Xquiq went for protection to the home of Xmucane,
who now looked after the young Hunbatz and Hunchouen. Xmucane would
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb18" href="#pb18" name=
"pb18">18</a>]</span>not at first believe her tale. But Xquiq appealed
to the gods, and performed a miracle by gathering a basket of maize
where no maize grew, and thus gained her confidence.</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards Xquiq became the mother of twin boys, the heroes
of the First Book, Hun-Ahpu, and Xbalanque. These did not find favour
in the eyes of Xmucane, their grandmother. Their infantile cries
aroused the wrath of this venerable person, and she vented it upon them
by turning them out of doors. They speedily took to an outdoor life,
however, and became mighty hunters, and expert in the use of their
<span class="corr" id="xd26e272" title=
"Source: blowpipes">blow-pipes</span>, with which they shot birds and
other small game. The ill-treatment which they received from Hunbatz
and Hunchouen caused them at last to retaliate, and those who had made
their lives miserable were punished by being transformed by the divine
children into apes. The venerable Xmucane, filled with grief at the
metamorphosis and flight of her ill-starred grandsons, who had made her
home joyous with their singing and flute-playing, was told that she
would be permitted to behold their faces once more if she could do so
without losing her gravity, but their antics and grimaces caused her
such merriment that on three separate occasions she was unable to
restrain her laughter and the men-monkeys appeared no more. Hun-Ahpu
and Xbalanque now became expert <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb19"
href="#pb19" name="pb19">19</a>]</span>musicians, and one of their
favourite airs was that of &ldquo;Hun-Ahpu qoy,&rdquo; the
&ldquo;monkey of Hun-Ahpu.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The divine twins were now old enough to undertake labour in the
field, and their first task was the clearing of a milpa or
maize-plantation. They were possessed of magic tools, which had the
merit of working themselves in the absence of the young hunters at the
chase, and those they found a capital substitute for their own
directing presence upon the first day. Returning at night from hunting,
they smeared their faces and hands with dirt so that Xmucane might be
deceived into imagining that they had been hard at work in the
maize-field. But during the night the wild beasts met and replaced all
the roots and shrubs which the brothers&mdash;or rather their magic
tools&mdash;had removed. The twins resolved to watch for them on the
ensuing night, but despite all their efforts the animals succeeded in
making good their escape, save one, the rat, which was caught in a
handkerchief. The rabbit and deer lost their tails in getting away. The
rat, in gratitude that they had spared its life, told them of the
glorious deeds of their great fathers and uncles, their games at ball,
and of the existence of a set of implements necessary to play the game
which they had left in the house. They discovered these, and went to
play in the ball-ground of their fathers.</p>
<p>It was not long, however, until Hun-Came and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb20" href="#pb20" name=
"pb20">20</a>]</span>Vukub-Came, the princes of Xibalba, heard them at
play, and decided to lure them to the Underworld as they had lured
their fathers. Messengers were despatched to the house of Xmucane, who,
filled with alarm, despatched a louse to carry the message to her
grandsons. The louse, wishing to ensure greater speed to reach the
brothers, consented to be swallowed by a toad, the toad by a serpent,
and the serpent by the great bird Voc. The other animals duly liberated
one another; but despite his utmost efforts, the toad could not get rid
of the louse, who had played him a trick by lodging in his gums, and
had not been swallowed at all. The message, however, was duly
delivered, and the players returned home to take leave of their
grandmother and mother. Before their departure they each planted a cane
in the middle of the house, which was to acquaint those they left
behind with their welfare, since it would wither if any fatal
circumstance befel them.</p>
<p>Pursuing the route their fathers had followed, they passed the river
of blood and the river Papuhya. But they sent an animal called Xan as
<i>avant courier</i> with orders to prick all the Xibalbans with a hair
from Hun-Ahpu&rsquo;s leg, thus discovering those of the dwellers in
the Underworld who were made of wood&mdash;those whom their fathers had
unwittingly bowed to as men&mdash;and also learning the names of the
others by their inquiries and explanations <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb21" href="#pb21" name="pb21">21</a>]</span>when
pricked. Thus they did not salute the mannikins on their arrival at the
Xibalban court, nor did they sit upon the red-hot stone. They even
passed scatheless through the first ordeal of the House of Gloom. The
Xibalbans were furious, and their wrath was by no means allayed when
they found themselves beaten at the game of ball to which they had
challenged the brothers. Then Hun-Came and Vukub-Came ordered the twins
to bring them four bouquets of flowers, asking the guards of the royal
gardens to watch most carefully, and committed Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque
to the &ldquo;House of Lances&rdquo;&mdash;the second
ordeal&mdash;where the lancers were directed to kill them. The
brothers, however, had at their beck and call a swarm of ants, which
entered the royal gardens on the first errand, and they succeeded in
bribing the lancers. The Xibalbans, white with fury, ordered that the
owls, the guardians of the gardens, should have their lips split, and
otherwise showed their anger at their third defeat.</p>
<p>Then came the third ordeal in the &ldquo;House of Cold.&rdquo; Here
the heroes escaped death by freezing by being warmed with burning
pine-cones. In the fourth and fifth ordeals they were equally lucky,
for they passed a night each in the &ldquo;House of Tigers&rdquo; and
the &ldquo;House of Fire&rdquo; without injury. But at the sixth ordeal
misfortune overtook them in the &ldquo;House of Bats.&rdquo;
Hun-Ahpu&rsquo;s <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>head being cut off by Camazotz, &ldquo;Ruler of
Bats,&rdquo; who suddenly appeared from above.</p>
<p>The beheading of Hun-Ahpu does not, however, appear to have
terminated fatally, but owing to the unintelligible nature of the text
at this juncture, it is impossible to ascertain in what manner he was
cured of such a lethal wound. This episode is followed by an assemblage
of all the animals, and another contest at ball-playing, after which
the brothers emerged uninjured from all the ordeals of the
Xibalbans.</p>
<p>But in order to further astound their &ldquo;hosts,&rdquo; Hun-Ahpu
and Xbalanque confided to two sorcerers named Xulu and Pacaw that the
Xibalbans had failed because the animals were not on their side, and
directing them what to do with their bones, they stretched themselves
upon a funeral pile and died together. Their bones were beaten to
powder and thrown into the river, where they sank, and were transformed
into young men. On the fifth day they reappeared like men-fishes, and
on the sixth in the form of ragged old men, dancing, burning and
restoring houses, killing and restoring each other to life, with other
wonders. The princes of Xibalba, hearing of their skill, requested them
to exhibit their magical powers, which they did by burning the royal
palace and restoring it, killing and resuscitating the king&rsquo;s
dog, and cutting a man in pieces, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb23" href="#pb23" name="pb23">23</a>]</span>bringing him to life
again. The monarchs of Xibalba, anxious to experience the novel
sensation of a temporary death, requested to be slain and resuscitated.
They were speedily killed, but the brothers refrained from
resuscitating their arch-enemies.</p>
<p>Announcing their real names, the brothers proceeded to punish the
princes of Xibalba. The game of ball was forbidden them, they were to
perform menial tasks, and only the beasts of the forest were they to
hold in vassalage. They appear after this to achieve a species of
doubtful distinction as plutonic deities or demons. They are described
as warlike, ugly as owls, inspiring evil and discord. Their faces were
painted black and white to show their faithless nature.</p>
<p>Xmucane, waiting at home for the brothers, was alternately filled
with joy and grief as the canes grew green and withered, according to
the varying fortunes of her grandsons. These young men were busied at
Xibalba with paying fitting funeral honours to their father and uncle,
who now mounted to heaven and became the sun and moon, whilst the four
hundred youths slain by Zipacna became the stars. Thus concludes the
second book.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Third Book</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The beginning of the third book finds the gods once
more in council. In the darkness they <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb24" href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>commune concerning the
creation of man. The Creator and Former made four perfect men. These
beings were wholly created from yellow and white maize. Their names
were Balam-Quitz&eacute; (Tiger with the Sweet Smile), Balam-Agab
(Tiger of the Night), Mahucutah (The Distinguished Name), and Iqi-Balam
(Tiger of the Moon). They had neither father nor mother, neither were
they made by the ordinary agents in the work of creation. Their
creation was a miracle of the Former.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e313src" href="#xd26e313" name="xd26e313src">6</a></p>
<p>But Hurakan was not altogether satisfied with his handiwork. These
men were too perfect<span class="corr" id="xd26e318" title=
"Not in source">.</span> They knew overmuch. Therefore the gods took
counsel as to how to proceed with man. They must not become as gods
(note here the Christian influence). Let us now contract their sight so
that they may only be able to see a portion of the earth and be
content, said the gods. Then Hurakan breathed a cloud over their eyes,
which became partially veiled. Then the four men slept, and four women
were made, Caha-Paluma (Falling Water), Choimha (Beautiful Water),
Tzununiha (House of the Water), and Cakixa (Water of Aras or Parrots),
who became the wives of the men in their respective order as mentioned
above.</p>
<p>These were the ancestors of the Kich&eacute;s only. Then were
created the ancestors of other peoples. They were ignorant of the
methods of worship, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href="#pb25"
name="pb25">25</a>]</span>and lifting their eyes to heaven prayed to
the Creator, the Former, for peaceable lives and the return of the sun.
But no sun came, and they grew uneasy. So they set out for Tulan-Zuiva,
or the Seven Caves, and there gods were given unto them, each man, as
head of a group of the race, a god. Balam-Quitz&eacute; received the
god Tohil. Balam-Agab received the god Avilix, and Mahucutah the god
Hacavitz. Iqi-Balam received a god, but as he had no family his god is
not taken into account in the native mythology.</p>
<p>The Kich&eacute;s now began to feel the want of fire, and the god
Tohil, the creator of fire, supplied them with this element. But soon
afterwards a mighty rain extinguished all the fires in the land. Tohil,
however, always renewed the supply. And fire in those days was the
chief necessity, for as yet there was no sun.</p>
<p>Tulan was a place of misfortune to man, for not only did he suffer
from cold and famine, but here his speech was so confounded that the
first four men were no longer able to comprehend each other. They
determined to leave Tulan, and under the leadership of the god Tohil
set out to search for a new abode. On they wandered through innumerable
hardships. Many mountains had they to climb, and a long passage to make
through the sea which was miraculously divided for their journey from
shore to shore. At length they came to a mountain <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb26" href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>which
they called Hacavitz, after one of their gods, and here they rested,
for here they had been instructed that they should see the sun. And the
sun appeared. Animals and men were transported with delight. All the
celestial bodies were now established. But the sun was not as it is
to-day. He was not strong, but as reflected in a mirror.</p>
<p>As he arose the three tribal gods were turned into stone, as were
the gods&mdash;probably totems&mdash;connected with the wild animals.
Then arose the first Kich&eacute; city.</p>
<p>As time progressed the first men grew old, and, impelled by visions,
they began to offer human sacrifices. For this purpose they raided the
villages of the neighbouring peoples, who retaliated. But by the
miraculous aid of a horde of wasps and hornets the Kich&eacute;s
utterly routed their enemies. And the aliens became tributory to
them.</p>
<p>Now it came nigh the death-time of the first men, and they called
their descendants together to hearken unto their last counsels. In the
anguish of their hearts they sang the Kamucu, the song &ldquo;We
see,&rdquo; that they had sung when it first became light. Then they
took leave of their wives and sons, one by one. And suddenly they were
not. But in their place was a huge bundle, which was never unfolded.
And it was called the &ldquo;Majesty Enveloped.&rdquo; And so died the
first men of the Kich&eacute;s. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27"

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Fourth Book brings us down to what is presumably
history. We say &ldquo;presumably,&rdquo; because we have only the bare
testimony of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; to go upon. We can note
therein the evolution of the Kich&eacute; people from a comparatively
simple and pastoral state of society to a political condition of
considerable complexity. This account of the later periods is extremely
confused, and as the names of many of the Kich&eacute; monarchs are the
same as those of the gods, it is often difficult to discriminate
between saga and history. Interminable conflicts are the subject of
most of this book, and by the time the transcriber reached the twelfth
chapter he seems to have tired of his labours and to have made up his
mind to conclude with a genealogical list of the Kich&eacute; kings. He
here traces the genealogies of the three royal houses of Cavek, Nihaib,
and Ahau-Kich&eacute;. The state of transition and turmoil in which the
country was for many years after the conquest must have tended to the
disappearance of native records of any kind, and our author does not
appear to have been as well versed in the history of his country which
immediately preceded his own time as he was in her mythology and
legends. According to a tradition recited by Don Domingo Juarros in his
&ldquo;History of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href="#pb28"
name="pb28">28</a>]</span>Kingdom of Guatemala,&rdquo; the Toltecs
emigrated from the neighbourhood of Tula in Mexico by direction of an
oracle, in consequence of the great increase of population in the reign
of Nimaquich&eacute;, fifth King of the Toltecs. &ldquo;In performing
this journey they expended many years and suffered extraordinary
hardships.&rdquo; Nimaquich&eacute; was succeeded by his son Aexopil,
from whom was descended Kicab Tanub, the contemporary of Montezuma II.
This does not at all agree with the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; account.

<h2 class="main">COSMOGONY OF THE &ldquo;POPOL VUH&rdquo;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The cosmogony of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; exhibits
many signs of Christian influence, but it would be quite erroneous to
infer that such influence was of a direct nature; that is, that the
native compiler deliberately infused into the original narrative those
outstanding features of the Christian cosmogony, which were undoubtedly
quite familiar to him. The resemblance which is apparent between the
first few chapters of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; and the creation-myth
in Genesis is no more the result of design than was the metamorphosis
of King Arthur&rsquo;s Brythonic warriors into Norman knights by the
jongleurs. The inclusion of obviously Christian elements was
undoubtedly unconscious. A native Guatemalan, nurtured in the Christian
faith, could, in fact, quite be expected to produce an incongruous
blending of Christian and pagan cosmogony such as is here dealt
with.</p>
<p>But another and more important question arises in connection with
the initial chapters of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo;&mdash;those which
give an account of the Kich&eacute; creation-myth. Under the veneer of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span>Biblical cosmogony the original myth would appear
to be the sum of more than one native creation-story. We have here a
number of beings, each of whom appear in some manner to exercise the
function of a creator, and it might be gathered from this that the
account now before us was produced by the fusion and reconciliation of
more than one legend connected with the creation&mdash;a reconciliation
of early rival faiths. We have to guide us in this the proved facts of
a composite Peruvian cosmogony. The ruling Inca caste skilfully welded
together no less than four early creation-myths, reserving for their
own divine ancestors the headship of the heavens. And it is not
unreasonable to believe that the diverse ethnological elements of which
the Maya-Kich&eacute; people were undoubtedly composed possessed
divergent cosmogonies, which were reconciled to one another in the
later traditional versions of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This would lead to the further supposition that the &ldquo;Popol
Vuh&rdquo; is a monument of very considerable antiquity. The fusion of
religious beliefs is, even with savages, a work of many generations. It
would be rash to attempt to discover any approximate date for the
original conception of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo; The only version
which we possess is that now under review, and as the lack of an
earlier version makes comparison impossible, we are thus without the
guidance with which the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href=
"#pb31" name="pb31">31</a>]</span>criteria of philology would
undoubtedly furnish us. That the Mayan civilisation was of very
considerable antiquity is possible, although no adequate proof exists
for the assumption. This much is certain: that at the period of the
Conquest written language was still in a state of transition from the
pictographic to the phonetic-ideographic stage, and that therefore no
version of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; which had been fixed by its
receiving literary form could have long existed. It is much more
probable that it existed for many generations by being handed down from
mouth to mouth&mdash;a manner of literary preservation exceedingly
common with the American peoples. The memories of the natives of
America were and still are matter for astonishment for all who come
into contact with them. The Conquistadores were astounded at the ease
with which the Mexicans could recite poems and orations of stupendous
length, and numerous instances of Indian feats of mnemonics are on
record.</p>
<p>It is worthy of notice that the Kich&eacute; myth embodies the
general aboriginal idea of creation which prevailed in the New World.
In many of them the central idea of creation is supplied by the
brooding of a great bird over the dark primeval waste of waters. Thus
the Athapascans thought that a mighty raven, with eyes of fire and
wings whose clapping was as the thunder, descended to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name="pb32">32</a>]</span>the
ocean and raised the earth to its surface.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e364src" href="#xd26e364" name="xd26e364src">1</a> The Muscokis
believed that a couple of pigeons, skimming the surface of the deep,
espied a blade of grass upon its surface, which slowly evolved into the
dry land.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e367src" href="#xd26e367" name=
"xd26e367src">2</a> The Zu&ntilde;is imagined that Awonawilona, the
All-father, so impregnated the waters that a scum appeared upon their
surface which became the earth and sky.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e370src" href="#xd26e370" name="xd26e370src">3</a> The Iroquois
said that their female ancestor, expelled from heaven by her angry
spouse, landed upon the sea, from which mud at once arose. The Mixtecs
imagined that two winds&mdash;those of the Nine Serpents and the Nine
Caverns&mdash;under the guise of a bird and a winged serpent
respectively, caused the waters to subside and the land to appear. The
Costa Rican Guaymis related, according to Melendez, that Noncomala
waded into the water and met the water-nymph Rutbe, who bore him twins,
the sun and moon. In all these accounts, from widely divergent nations,
it is surprising to note such unanimity of belief; and when the
tenacity of legend is borne in mind, it is perhaps not too rash to
state a belief in an original American creation-myth, which seems none
the less possible when the fact of the ethnological unity among the
American tribes is remembered. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb33"
href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span></p>
<p>It is by no means difficult to satisfactorily prove the genuine
American character of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo; In its case reading
is believing. Macpherson, in his preface to the first edition of the
poems of Ossian, says of an &ldquo;ingenious gentleman&rdquo; that ere
he had read the poems he thought and remarked that a man diffident of
his abilities might well ascribe these compositions to a person living
in a remote antiquity; but when he had perused them his sentiments were
changed. He found they abounded too much with those ideas that only
belong to an early state of society to be the work of a modern poet.
However this may apply to the reputed compositions of the Goidelic
bard, there can be no doubt that it can be used with justice as regards
the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo; To any one who has given it a careful
examination it must be abundantly evident that it is a composition that
has passed through several stages of development; that it is
unquestionably of aboriginal origin; and that it has only been
influenced by European thought in a secondary and unessential manner.
The very fact that it was composed in the Kich&eacute; tongue is almost
sufficient proof of its genuine American character. The scholarship of
the nineteenth century was unequal to the adequate translation of the
&ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo;; the twentieth century has as yet shown no
signs of being able to accomplish the task. It is, therefore, not
difficult <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name=
"pb34">34</a>]</span>to credit that if modern scholarship is unable to
properly translate the work, that of the eighteenth century was unable
to create it; no European of that epoch was sufficiently versed in
Kich&eacute; theology and history to compose in faultless Kich&eacute;
such a work as the &ldquo;Popol Vuh,&rdquo; breathing as it does in
every line an intimate and natural acquaintance with the antiquities of
Guatemala.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is not the only mythi-historical work
composed by an aboriginal American. In Mexico Ixtlilxochitl, and in
Peru Garcilasso de la Vega, wrote exhaustive treatises upon the history
and customs of their native countrymen shortly after the conquests of
Mexico and Peru, and hieroglyphic records, such as the &ldquo;Wallam
Olum,&rdquo; are not unknown among the North American Indians. In fact,
the intelligence which fails to regard the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; as a
genuine aboriginal production must be more sceptical than critical.</p>

Mythology</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The connection of Kich&eacute; and Mayan mythology
with that of Mexico is obvious, but not altogether proven. It is
possible that the main lines of the three systems were similar; that
certain great deities like Gucumatz were common to all, but that the
inclusion of local gods lent a very different complexion to the three
mythologies. It <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name=
"pb35">35</a>]</span>also seems not unreasonable to suppose that the
Kich&eacute; people must have been more liable to influence from the
south, that is, from the north of South America. The inclusion of an
Antillean deity (Hurakan) in their pantheon practically proves that
they were, and their relative proximity to the Caribs&mdash;the great
maritime race of America&mdash;leads to the assumption that they may
have been influenced by those roving merchants and sailors more or less
profoundly. This, however, can only be matter for surmise, and, however
strong the probabilities seem in favour of such a theory, proof is
wanting to strengthen it. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb36" href=

<h2 class="main">THE PANTHEON OF THE &ldquo;POPOL VUH&rdquo;</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It must be remembered that we are dealing with
Kich&eacute; and not with Mayan mythology. Although the two had much in
common, it would be most unsafe in the present state of knowledge to
attempt to identify Kich&eacute; with Mayan deities; such an attempt
would, indeed, assume the bulk of a formidable treatise. Scholarship at
the present time hesitates to designate the representations of Mayan
gods on the walls of &ldquo;buried&rdquo; cities otherwise than by a
letter of the alphabet, and it is therefore wise to thoroughly ignore
the question of Mayan affinities in dealing with myths purely
Kich&eacute;. This does not apply to the Kich&eacute;-Mexican
affinities. Mexican and Kich&eacute; deities are mostly known
quantities, but this cannot be said of their Mayan congenors. The
reason for this is that until Mayan myth is reconciled with the
evidence of the Mayan monuments no certitude can be arrived at. This
cannot well be achieved until the Mayan hieroglyphs give up their
secret, a contingency of which there is no immediate likelihood.
Bearing this in mind, we may proceed to a brief consideration
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name=
"pb37">37</a>]</span>of the Kich&eacute; pantheon and its probable
Mexican affinities.</p>
<p>Almost at the beginning we encounter a pair of masculine-feminine
beings of a type nearly hermaphroditic, named Xpiyacoc and Xmucane, who
are credited with a considerable share of the creation of organic life
in the Kich&eacute; <span class="corr" id="xd26e398" title=
"Source: cosmogomy">cosmogony</span>. These, we will remember, appeared
in the myth of Vukub-Cakix and elsewhere. The first appears to apply to
the paternal function, whilst the name Xmucane is derived from words
signifying &ldquo;feminine vigour.&rdquo; The Mexican equivalents of
these gods were probably Cipactonatl and Oxomoco, the &ldquo;father and
mother gods.&rdquo;<a class="noteref" id="xd26e401src" href="#xd26e401"
name="xd26e401src">1</a></p>
<p>Deities who early arrest our attention are Tepeu, Gucumatz and
Hurakan. The name of the first signifies &ldquo;king.&rdquo; According
to Brinton this in Kich&eacute; applies to rulership chiefly, inasmuch
as the conjugal prowess often ascribed to monarchs by savage people is
concerned. A creative faculty is obviously indicated in the name, but
Brinton assumes that this Kich&eacute; generic name for king can also
be rendered &ldquo;syphilitic,&rdquo; especially as the name of the
Mexican sun-god Nanahuatl has a similar significance.</p>
<p>That Tepeu was a generative force, a creative deity, there can be no
doubt, but strangely enough in certain passages of the &ldquo;Popol
Vuh&rdquo; we find <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href="#pb38"
name="pb38">38</a>]</span>him praying to and rendering homage to
Hurakan, the &ldquo;Heart of Heaven.&rdquo; We also find the latter
along with Xpiyacoc, Xmucane and Tepeu jointly and severally
responsible for the creation of the mannikins, if not for the whole
cosmological scheme. This, of course, bears out the assumption of a
composite origin of the creation-myth in the &ldquo;Popol Vuh,&rdquo;
but it is nevertheless strange to find Hurakan, whom we must reckon an
alien deity, at the head of these Olympic councils.</p>
<p>Cucumatz is one and the same with the Nahuatlacan&mdash;or, more
properly speaking, Toltecan Quetzalcohuatl. The name is compounded from
two Kich&eacute; words signifying &ldquo;Feathered Serpent,&rdquo; and
its meaning in the Nahuatl is precisely the same. Concerning the nature
of this deity, there is probably more difference of opinion than in the
case of any other known to comparative mythology. Strangely enough,
although unquestionably an alien in the mythology of the Aztecan branch
of the Nahuatlac&acirc;, he bulks more largely in the myths of that
people than in the legends of the Kich&eacute;s. To the Aztec&acirc; he
seems to have appeared as a half-friendly Baal, to worship or revile
according to the opportunism of national fortune. If he were here to be
dealt with as his importance demands the limits of this monograph would
speedily be surpassed. Although unquestionably the same god to both
Mexicans and Kich&eacute;s, he had <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39"
href="#pb39" name="pb39">39</a>]</span>acquired a significance in
Aztecan eyes quite out of all proportion to his Kich&eacute; or Mayan
importance. To the Aztecan mind he was a culture-hero, unalterably
associated with the sun, and with the origins of their civilisation. To
the Toltecs he was the &ldquo;Man of the Sun,&rdquo; the traveller,
who, with staff in hand, symbolised the daily journey of the Sun-god.
In all likelihood Quetzalcohuatl was evolved upon Mexican soil by the
Toltecs, perhaps adopted from some older cultus by them. He was at
least worshipped sedulously by aboriginal or pre-Aztecan tribes in
Anahuac. Mr. Payne writes:<a class="noteref" id="xd26e416src" href=
"#xd26e416" name="xd26e416src">2</a> &ldquo;The fact that the worship
of Quetzalcohuatl under the name of Cuculcan or Gucumatz was
extensively prevalent in Yucatan and Central America, while no trace is
found of the worship of Tezcatlipoca, strongly suggests that the
founders of the Central American pueblos (the Toltecs) were, in fact,
devotees of Quetzalcohuatl, who preferred exile and adventure in
strange lands to accepting a religious innovation which was intolerable
to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That Quetzalcohuatl was not an aboriginal Maya-Kich&eacute; deity is
proved by the relative importance granted him by a people&mdash;the
Aztec&acirc;&mdash;to whom he was alien; and that they regarded him as
the aboriginal god of Anahuac <i>par excellence</i> is indisputable.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=

<p>Hurakan, the winged creative power, is the wind of the
tempest.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e427src" href="#xd26e427" name=
"xd26e427src">3</a> In the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; he is designated
&ldquo;The Heart of Heaven.&rdquo; He is parallel with if not identical
to the Aztecan deity Tezcatlipoca, who in his variant of Yoalli-ehecatl
(the Wind of Night) was supplicated by the Aztec&acirc; as the
life-breath.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e433src" href="#xd26e433" name=
"xd26e433src">4</a> Elsewhere we have hinted that Tezcatlipoca may have
been an ice-god.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e436src" href="#xd26e436"
name="xd26e436src">5</a> Mr. Payne sees in him an elaboration of the
vision of death in a polished &ldquo;scrying&rdquo;-stone, which seems
possible but scarcely probable. Hurakan was in all likelihood derived
from an original deity of the Antilles.<a class="noteref" id=
"xd26e439src" href="#xd26e439" name="xd26e439src">6</a> The term
&ldquo;hurricane&rdquo; is said to have originated from the name of
this god, and although the direct evidence for this is scanty, other
circumstances place the connection beyond reasonable doubt. Hurakan is
also alluded to in the &ldquo;Popol Vuh,&rdquo; as &ldquo;The Strong
Serpent,&rdquo; and &ldquo;He who hurls below,&rdquo; referring to his
presence in the lightning. Brinton is of opinion that the name Hurakan
signifies &ldquo;giant,&rdquo; but the sequence of proof is not
altogether convincing. Hurakan had the assistance of three demiurges,
named respectively Cakulha-Hurakan (lightning), Chipi-Cakulha
(lightning-flash), and Raxa-Cakulha (track-of-the-lightning).
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p>Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque, who appear in the first myth
proper&mdash;that of the destruction of Vukub-Cakix, are certainly
&ldquo;of the gods,&rdquo; but seem to be only demi-gods. They are
constantly alluded to as &ldquo;young men.&rdquo; Brasseur de
Bourbourg, who saw in the Vukub-Cakix myth the struggle between the
Toltecs and the invading Nahuatlac&acirc;, believed these hero-gods to
be equivalents of Tezcatlipoca and Nanahuatl, but the resemblance
appears to exist merely in the martial character of the deities, and is
hardly noticeable in other details. Hun-Ahpu would appear to signify
&ldquo;The Master,&rdquo; but Brinton translates the name as
&ldquo;Magician.&rdquo; It may have a reconciliatory translation as
&ldquo;Adept.&rdquo; A variant is the name of his father Hun-Hun-Ahpu,
&ldquo;Each-one-a-Magician,&rdquo; and some confusion is apparent in
the Vukub-Cakix myth between the two names; but as the Abb&eacute;
Brasseur de Bourbourg so justly observes, &ldquo;these names are so
symbolic in character that their absolute elucidation is
impossible.&rdquo; Xbalanque signifies &ldquo;Little Tiger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gods of the Kich&eacute;s were legion,&rdquo; but the
foregoing list embraces practically all the deities proper with whom we
have to deal in the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="first">The outstanding point of interest in the myth of
Vukub-Cakix and his two sons is its terrestrial <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=

as were the Jotuns of Scandinavian mythology there can be no doubt.
Like the Jotuns or the Titans, Vukub-Cakix and his progeny are made
<i>from</i> the earth, and the parent giant is a living representation
of its surface. Xpiyacoc and Xmucane remove his emerald teeth, and
replace them with maize grains&mdash;surely a mythical interpretation
or allegory of the removal of the green virgin turf of the earth, and
its replacement by the maize seed. It is further worthy of notice that
the maize is placed in Vukub-Cakix&rsquo;s mouth by divine beings. In
the third book of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; it is stated that the
gods gave maize to man. It was, indeed, brought to earth from heaven by
the sacred animals.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Second Book of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is the
most interesting of the four from a mythological point of view. That it
treats of the dealings of the Kich&eacute;s with the aboriginal people
of the district they afterwards inhabited is not unlikely. Although the
opinion of Brasseur that Xibalba was a prehistoric state which had
Palenque for its capital is an exaggeration of <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e465" title="Source: whatsover">whatsoever</span> kernel of fact
may be contained in the myth, yet it is not unlikely that the
Abb&eacute;, who so often astonishes without illuminating, has in this
instance come <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=

Colorado have of late years aroused speculation as to the aboriginal or
directly prehistoric peoples of these regions. The &ldquo;Popol
Vuh&rdquo; definitely describes Xibalba as the metropolis of an
&ldquo;Underworld&rdquo;; and with such examples as that of the Cliff
Palace Ca&ntilde;on in Colorado before us, it is difficult to think
that allusion is not made to some such semi-underground abode. There
the living rock has been excavated to a considerable distance,
advantage being taken of a huge natural recess to secure greater depth
than could possibly have been attained by human agency, and in this
immense alcove the ruins of a veritable city may still be seen, almost
as well preserved as in the days of its evacuation, its towers,
battlements and houses being as well marked and as plainly discernible
as are the ruins of Phil&aelig;. It is then not unreasonable to suppose
that in a more northerly home the Kich&eacute;s may have warred with a
race which dwelt in some such subterranean locality. A people&rsquo;s
idea of an &ldquo;otherworld&rdquo; is often coloured by the
configuration of their own country.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: a hell, an abode of bad spirits as
distinguished from beneficent gods, Xibalba was <i>not</i>. The
American Indian was innocent of the idea of maleficent deities pitted
in everlasting warfare against good and life-giving gods until contact
with the whites coloured his mythology <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>with their idea of the
dual nature of supernatural beings.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e477src"
href="#xd26e477" name="xd26e477src">7</a> The transcriber of the
&ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; makes this clear so far as Kich&eacute; belief
went. Dimly conscious that the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; was coloured by
his agency with the opinions of a lately adopted Christianity, he says
of the Lords of Xibalba, Hun-Came and Vukub-Came: &ldquo;In the old
times they did not have much power. They were but annoyers and opposers
of men, and, in truth, <i>they were not regarded as gods</i>.&rdquo; If
not regarded as gods, then, what were they?</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil,&rdquo; says Cogolludo of the Mayas, &ldquo;is
called by them Xibilba, which means he who disappears or
vanishes.&rdquo; The derivation of Xibalba is from a root meaning
&ldquo;to fear&rdquo; from which comes the name for a ghost or phantom.
Xibalba was, then, the Place of Phantoms. But it was not the Place of
Torment, the abode of a devil who presided over punishment. The idea of
sin is weak in the savage mind; and the idea of punishment for sin in a
future state is unknown in pre-Christian American mythology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the influence of Christian catechising,&rdquo; says
Brinton, &ldquo;the Quich&eacute; legends portray this really as a
place of torment, and its rulers as malignant and powerful; but as I
have before pointed out they do so protesting that such was not the
ancient belief, and they let fall no word that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb45" href="#pb45" name="pb45">45</a>]</span>shows
that it was regarded as the destination of the morally bad. The
original meaning of the name given by Cogolludo points unmistakably to
the simple fact of disappearance from among men, and corresponds in
harmlessness to the true sense of those words of fear, Scheol, Hades,
Hell, all signifying hidden from sight, and only endowed with more grim
associations by the imaginations of later generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of consigning elder peoples, who have been displaced in the
land to an underworld, is not uncommon in mythology. The Xibalbans, or
aborigines, were perhaps cave- or earth-dwellers like the Picts of
Scottish folk-lore, gnomeish, and full of elvish tricks, as such folk
usually are. Vanished people are, too, often classed with the dead, or
as lords of the dead. It is well known, also, that legend speedily
crystallises around the name of a dispossessed race, to whom is
attributed every description of magic art. This is sometimes accounted
for by the fact that the displaced people possessed a higher culture
than their invaders, and sometimes, probably, by the dread which all
barbarian peoples have of a religion in any way differing from their
own. Thus the Norwegians credited the Finns&mdash;their predecessors in
Norway&mdash;with tremendous magical powers, and similar instances of
respectful timidity shown by invading races towards the original
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb46" href="#pb46" name=
"pb46">46</a>]</span>inhabitants of the country they had conquered
could readily be multiplied. To be tricked the barbarian regards as a
mortal indignity, as witness the wrath of Thor in Jotunheim, comparable
with the sensitiveness of Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque lest they should be
outwitted by the Xibalbans.</p>

<h3 class="main"><span class="sc">The Harrying of Xibalba</span></h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The doings of Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque, in Xibalba, may
be regarded either as the Kich&eacute; account of the adventures of two
veritable heroes in a new land, or as the visitation of divine beings
to Hades for the express purpose of conquering death. But by the period
of the formation of the myth it is probable that Xibalba had become
confounded with the Place of the Dead, and was regarded as a fit
theatre for the prodigies of craft and valour of the young hero-gods.
The Kich&eacute; Hades had, in fact, evolved from the old northern
home, exactly as had the Mexican Mictlan, which, although a
subterranean locality, was also, and separately, a northern country. A
complete Place of the Dead had been established, and the gods, to show
their contempt of death, must descend thereto and emerge triumphant.
The idea of metempsychosis was known to the American aboriginal mind.
&ldquo;We Indians shall not for ever die; even the grains of corn we
put under the earth grow up and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb47"
href="#pb47" name="pb47">47</a>]</span>become living things,&rdquo; is
the noble and touching reply of a chief to the interrogation of a
Moravian Brother, regarding the native belief in immortality.<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e503src" href="#xd26e503" name="xd26e503src">8</a>
Man must have the example of the gods, if he wishes to live in peace
and quiet assurance of immortality. And just as we believe that our God
descended into Hell and vanquished Sin and Death, so did these simple
people gain strength to face Eternity from the thought that they had
been preceded in the dark journey by the Immortals.</p>
<p>It is evident that the divine brothers feared ridicule, and
profiting from the disasters of their father and uncle made sure of
knowing the names of the chief Xibalbans ere they set out. In like
manner they avoided making an obeisance to the dummy figures to which
their predecessors had bowed so profoundly. The American savage, grave
and reserved, cannot abide ridicule. He shrinks from it in a manner
which a less self-regarding or a more self-assured people cannot
comprehend. The other tests&mdash;the &ldquo;House of Tigers,&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;House of Cold,&rdquo; and the various torments mentioned
in the Second Book are much what might be expected from a barbarian
idea of death&mdash;no more horrible, perhaps, than the European idea
of Hell in the Middle Ages, certainly not more fear-compelling than the
picture of Dante. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb48" href="#pb48"
name="pb48">48</a>]</span></p>
<p>The American peoples are at one in their belief in a Paradise, a
Place of Joy, if not of Reward. Their Hades appears to have been
reserved almost entirely for the unillustrious. Paradise in some
American mythologies, notably in that of Mexico, and perhaps in that of
Peru, is nothing more than a preserve of the great; the poor might not
enter therein, no more than might the coward pass the gates of the
Norse Valhalla. It was to Mictlan or Supay, then, that the popular mind
turned. How did the American peoples regard this drear abode? To enter
it one must cross a deep and swift river by means of a bridge formed of
a slender tree, said the Hurons and Iroquois to the first missionaries.
On this frail passage the soul must defend itself from the attacks of a
savage dog.<a class="noteref" id="xd26e514src" href="#xd26e514" name=
"xd26e514src">9</a> The Chepewayan Athapascans told of a great water
which the soul must cross in a stone canoe; the Chilians, of a western
sea, where toll must be given to an evil hag, who plucked out an eye if
payment were not forthcoming; the Algonquins, of a stream bridged by an
enormous snake. The Aztecs called this river Chicunoapa, the Nine
Rivers, where the departed must pay toll to a dog and a dragon. It will
be recollected that the brothers in the &ldquo;Popol Vuh,&rdquo; cross
a river of blood. This almost certainly alludes to the ocean under the
red beams of the setting sun, towards which all these voyages are made.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49" href="#pb49" name=
"pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>The hero-gods in the myth voluntarily succumb to the power of the
Lords of Death, and after being burned their bones are ground in a mill
and thrown into the waters. The belief was almost universal in America
that the soul resided in the bones. The bones were the basis of the
man. Flesh would readily perish, but would return to clothe this more
lasting foundation. So in many tribes the bones of the dead were
carefully preserved. In all Central American countries the bones of
distinguished persons were preserved in temples or council-houses in
the small chests made of cane mentioned by the chroniclers of De
Soto&rsquo;s expedition. This, too, may possibly have been the origin
of mummification in Peru. In Egypt all the members and intestines must
be preserved, in Peru only the bones. The state of comparative
desiccation in which most Peruvian mummies are discovered proves that
the preservation of the flesh or organs was not regarded as a
necessity.</p>
<p>The game of ball figures very largely throughout the Third Book. The
father and uncle of the young hero-gods were worsted in their favourite
sport by the Xibalbans, but Hun-Ahpu and Xbalanque in their turn
vanquish the Lords of the Underworld. This may have resembled the
Mexican game of tlachtli, which was played in an enclosed court with a
rubber ball between two opposite sides, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb50" href="#pb50" name="pb50">50</a>]</span>each of two or three
players. It was, in fact, not unlike hockey. This game of ball between
the Powers of Light and the Powers of Darkness is somewhat reminiscent
of that between Ormuzd and Ahriman in Persian myth. The game of
tlachtli had a symbolic reference to stellar motions.<a class="noteref"

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We are here engaged with the problem which the origin
of man presented to the Kich&eacute; mind, and we shall find that its
solution bears a remarkable likeness to that of similar American myths.
We seldom hear of one first-created being. In the creation-myths of the
New World four brothers are usually the progenitors of the human race.
Man in these myths is nearly always earth-born. He and his fellows
emerge from some cavern or subterranean place, fully grown and fully
armed. Thus the Blackfoot Indians emerged from Nina-stahu, a peak in
the Rockies. In the centre of Nunne Chaha, the High Hill, was a cavern,
the house of the Master of Breath, whence came the Choctaws. The
Peruvians come from Pacari Tambu, the House of the Dawn, near Cuzco,
and an ancient legend of the Aztec&acirc; states that they came from
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name=
"pb51">51</a>]</span>Chicomoztoc, the Seven Caverns, to the north of
Mexico.</p>
<p>We find the first Mayan men speedily engaged in migration. Such must
always be the life of the unsettled and unagricultural savage. He
multiplies. Gods are given to each tribe. These he bears to a new
country. In fact we have a complete migration myth in the Third Book of
the &ldquo;Popol Vuh,&rdquo; and there are not wanting signs to show
that this migration took place from the cold north to the warm south.
The principal item of proof in favour of such a theory is, of course,
the statement that the sun was &ldquo;not at first born,&rdquo; and
that at a later stage of the journey, when his beams appeared upon the
horizon, it was as a weaker and dimmer luminary that he seemed to the
wanderers than in after years. The allusion to &ldquo;shining
sand,&rdquo; by the aid of which they crossed rivers, may mean that
they forded them when covered with ice. The whole myth is so strikingly
akin to the Aztec&acirc;n migration-myth given in the Mexican MS. in
the Boturini Collection (No. 14, sec. viii.) that we cannot refrain
from appending a short passage from the latter:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the beginning of the record of the coming of the
Mexicans from the place called Aztlan. It is by means of the water that
they came this way, being four tribes, and in coming they rowed in
boats. They built their huts on <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52"
href="#pb52" name="pb52">52</a>]</span>piles at the place called the
Grotto of Quinevayan. It is there from which the eight tribes issued.
The first tribe is that of the Huexotzincos, the second tribe the
Chalcas, the third the Xochimilcas, the fourth the Cuitlavacas, the
fifth the Mallinalcas, the sixth the Chicimecas, the seventh the
Tepanecas, the eighth the Matlatzincas. It is there where they were
founded in Colhuacan. They were the colonists of it since they landed
there, coming from Aztlan&#8202;&hellip;. It is there that they soon
afterwards went away from, carrying before them the god<a class=
"noteref" id="xd26e546src" href="#xd26e546" name="xd26e546src">11</a>
Vitzillopochtli, which they had adopted for their god&#8202;&hellip;.
They came out of four places, when they went forward travelling this
way&#8202;&hellip;. There the eight tribes opened up our road <i>by
water</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We find a similar myth in the Wallam Olum, or painted records of the
Lenape Indians. &ldquo;After the flood,&rdquo; says this record,
&ldquo;the Lenape with the manly turtle beings dwelt close together at
the cave house and dwelling of Talli&#8202;&hellip;. They saw that the
snake land was bright and wealthy. Having all agreed, they went over
the <i>water of the frozen sea</i> to possess the land. It was
wonderful when they all went over the smooth deep water of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href="#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>the
frozen sea at the gap of snake sea in the great ocean&rdquo;<a href=
"#note5" id="nm5" name="nm5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>
<p>We thus see that the Third Book of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is a
migration saga of a type not uncommon in America. Asiatic tribes may
have come down from the Chi-Pixab of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; to
British Columbia, and thence by easy stages to Central America. And the
Third Book of the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; may be the distant echo of a
mighty wave of colonisation, whose sound swept the entire surface of
the New World.</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It cannot be said that the early Spanish authors upon
the affairs of Yucatan either corroborate or discredit the contents of
the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; in any way. To begin with, Landa,
Cogolludo, and Las Casas confine themselves more to Yucatan proper than
to Guatemala, and their remarks upon native belief, in so far as they
illustrate the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; at all, are really references to
Mayan myths. Palacios is meagre in his references to any native
beliefs, and the works of all four are so coloured by the phantasies of
medi&aelig;val theology that, although interesting, they possess little
real value. So far, in fact, as they throw light upon the &ldquo;Popol
Vuh&rdquo; they might be safely ignored, and they are only given as
works of reference in the bibliography for the sake of completeness.
They <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=

mythology proper, and for complete understanding of the &ldquo;Popol

myth is necessary.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">There is not wanting evidence to show that, like most
barbarous compositions which depended for their popularity upon the
ease with which they could be memorised, the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo;
was originally composed in metre. Passages here and there show a
decided metrical tendency, as:</p>

<p class="line">Yes, answered the old man.</p>
<p class="line">Then he spread apart his legs.</p>

<p>The first line almost scans in iambics (English style), and the
fifth is perfect, except for the truncation in the fourth foot. The
others appear to us to consist of that alternation of sustained
feet&mdash;musically represented by a semibreve&mdash;with pyrrhics,
which is characteristic of nearly all savage dance-poetry. Father Coto,
a missionary, observes that the natives were fond of telling long
stories and of repeating chants, keeping time to them in those dances
of which all the American aboriginal peoples appear to have been so
fond&mdash;and still are, as Baron <span class="corr" id="xd26e614"
title="Source: Nordenskjold">Nordenskj&ouml;ld</span> has recently
discovered in the Aymara country. These chants were called nugum tzih,
or &ldquo;garlands of words,&rdquo; and although the native compiler of
the &ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; appears to have been unable to recollect
the precise rhythm of the whole, many passages attest its original odic
character.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Note.</span>&mdash;The pronunciation of <i>x</i> in

<p class="first">The various works which contain notices of the
&ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; and the kindred questions of Mayan and
Kich&eacute; mythology are so difficult of access to the majority of
readers that it has been thought best to divide them into two classes:
(1) those which can be more or less readily purchased, and which are,
naturally, of more recent origin; and (2) those which are not easy to
come by, and which, generally speaking, are the work of Spanish priests
and colonists of the sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth
centuries.</p>

<p class="first">The work on the subject which is most easily obtained,
and indeed the only work which gives the original Kich&eacute; text, is
that of the Abb&eacute; Brasseur de Bourbourg, &ldquo;<span lang=
"fr">Vuh Popol: Le livre sacr&eacute; de Quich&eacute;s et les mythes
de l&rsquo;antiquit&eacute; Am&eacute;ricaine.</span>&rdquo; The
Kich&eacute; text was translated by the assistance of natives into
French, and the translation is more or less inaccurate. The notes and
introduction must be read by the student with the greatest caution. It
was published at Paris in 1861.</p>
<p>Ximenes&rsquo; translation into Spanish of the &ldquo;Popol
Vuh&rdquo; and that of Gavarrete are about of equal value, rather
inaccurate, and accompanied by scanty notes. The title of the first is
&ldquo;<span lang="es">Las Historias del Origin de los Indios de
Guatemala, par el R. P. F. Francisco Ximenes</span> (Vienna, 1856), and
of the second, &ldquo;<span lang="es">El Popol Vuh</span>,&rdquo; (San
Salvador <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=

exclusively concerning the &ldquo;Popol Vuh.&rdquo; The other works of
Brasseur and those of Brinton contain more or less numerous allusions
to it, but references to it in standard works of mythology are
exceedingly rare. The only other works which have a bearing upon the
subject are those upon Mayan and Kich&eacute; mythology, or which,
among other matter, historical or political, refer to it in any way.

illustrating the connection between the Kich&eacute; and Mayan

<p>The brief essay of the late Professor Max M&uuml;ller upon the
&ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; is of little or no value except as a statement
in favour of its authenticity. It gives little or no information

authenticity and nature of North American picture-drawings.</p>

<p class="first">Much that is absurd has been written concerning the
antiquity of the ruined cities of Central America, and some authors
have not hesitated to place their foundation in an antiquity beside
which the pre-dynastic buildings of Egypt would appear quite recent.
But that they were abandoned not long before the Columbian era is now
generally admitted. <i>See</i> Winsor&rsquo;s &ldquo;Narrative and
Critical History of America,&rdquo; chap, iii., and the works of
Charnay, Maler, Maudslay, and Gordon, for modern opinion upon the
subject; also the various monographs contained in the more recent
volumes of the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology&rsquo;s annual report. That a
very respectable antiquity belongs to several sites is, however,
certain; and competent authorities have not hesitated to ascribe to
some of the ruins an age of not less than two thousand years.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Payne has made it abundantly clear to our mind that
the original seat of the Nahuatlac&acirc; (which included both Toltecs
and Aztecs) was in British Columbia (<i>see</i> his &ldquo;History of
America,&rdquo; vol. ii. p. 373 <i>et seq.</i>). He thinks they there
occupied a position southerly to that of the Athapascan stock, and were
probably the first northern people to come into contact with tribes
possessed of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span>maize plant. The knowledge of this staple, he
infers, spread rapidly among the northern peoples, and induced them to
hasten their southern colonisation, but it does not appear to us
probable that this would be an inducement to a savage flesh-eating
people averse to a life of agricultural labour. The whole question of
pre-historic American migration, and of the gradual civilisation by
maize of the peoples who came within its zone, is most admirably
discussed in vol. xix. of &ldquo;The History of North America,&rdquo;
by W. J. Magee and Cyrus Thomas (Philadelphia, George Barrie and Sons),
published March 1908. The knowledge contained in this work is the
outcome of a lifetime&rsquo;s labour in the U.S. Bureau of Ethnology,
and its learned authors have undoubtedly produced a monumental treatise
which it will take many a generation of research to supersede, if,
indeed, that is possible.</p>

<p class="first">The authorities for the settlement of the Toltecs in
Yucatan are the Tezcucan chronicler Ixtlilxochitl, and Torquemada, who
both allege that the immigrants went to Campeachy and the south.</p>

<p class="first">There appear to be grounds for believing that the
parent deities Xpiyacoc and Xmucane are but derivations from Gucumatz,
and represent the male and female attributes of that god. In the
&ldquo;Popol Vuh&rdquo; they are spoken of as being &ldquo;covered with
green feathers,&rdquo; the usual description of Gucumatz; but it is, of
course, possible that they may have received some of his attributes in
the general jumble of myths which, we have attempted to show, exists in
the first book. Gucumatz, it will be remembered, is Quetzalcohuatl in
another form, and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63"
name="pb63">63</a>]</span>the latter is often represented in the papyri
as having a woman sitting opposite to him. She does not, however,
appear to be at all analogous to Messrs. F&ouml;rstemann and
Schellhas&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goddess I,&rdquo; whom I take to represent the
Mayan equivalent of Xmucane, and who wears on her head the knotted
serpent, a reptile characteristic of Quetzalcohuatl.</p>

<p class="first">The Wallam-Olum (painted records) of the Leni Lenape
Indians have often been called into question as regards their
authenticity, but the evidence of Lederer, Humboldt, Heckewelder,
Tanner, Loskiel, Beatty, and Rafinesque, all of whom professed to have
seen them, rather discounts such unbelief in their existence. They
consisted of picture-writings, or hieroglyphs, each of which applied to
a whole verse, or many words. The ideas were, in fact, amalgamated in a
compound system, and bear exactly the same relation to written language
as the American tongues did to spoken language; that is, they were of
an agglutinative type, a linguistic form where several words are welded
into one. There are several series, one of which records the doings of
the tribes immediately subsequent to the Creation. Another series
relates to their doings in America, and consists of seven songs, four
of sixteen verses of four words each, and three of twenty verses of
three words each &ldquo;It begins at the arrival in America,&rdquo;
says Rafinesque (&ldquo;The American Nations&rdquo;), &ldquo;and is
continued without hardly any interruption till the arrival of the
European colonists towards 1600.&rdquo; But this second series is a
mere meagre catalogue of kings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb64"

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including

to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
